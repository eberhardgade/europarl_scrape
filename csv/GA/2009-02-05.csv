2, 3. The placing on the market and use of feed for animals (debate) ,"  Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf,  rapporteur. – (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, today we are discussing what is known as the ‘open declaration’. This is about transparency with regard to feed as the basis for healthy food for consumers, and it is about giving purchasers of compound feed an overview of what is supplied to them.It has been a long road but, if we adopt this Regulation today, I hope this brings matters to a successful conclusion, and I should like to thank the Commission, which has helped us a great deal with its constructive work on the issues. The Commission encountered absolute political will on the part of Parliament to push through this open declaration, and also experienced a stubborn but fair debate with the Council. We can be proud of the results.Let us take a brief look at the history. We had the BSE crisis and, in 1997, the Temporary Committee of Inquiry issued its final report in which Parliament called for this open declaration. The Commission presented a proposal, which subsequently became Directive 2002/2/EC. In a compromise with the Council – this went through all the bodies – the Directive pushed through the open declaration, which meant that labels had to state the ingredients with a ± 15% tolerance, and the exact composition had to be provided on request.That was a directive rather than a regulation, and Member States implemented it only very hesitantly or not at all. The feed industry brought an action to the European Court of Justice, and the Court gave the following first-class confirmation: apart from the exact information, the legality of this Directive was not in dispute. We then took account of this judgment in a further procedure in Parliament, and have now brought matters to a conclusion in the form of this Regulation. I had the honour of being rapporteur each time and, throughout this long period, I enjoyed extremely intensive cooperation with the Commission that was based on trust.Today we have a result that has been fought for hard but fairly, and of which we can be proud. It is also apparent that it enjoys the support of the majority in this House and of the groups. There are no amendments, from which I conclude that this Regulation will indeed be adopted by a large majority. Therefore, we have a good Regulation that brings about the open declaration in three steps – you know what they are – firstly, the components in descending percentage order; secondly, the provision of information to feed businesses with a ± 15% tolerance – in this regard we have not laid down a reservation of intellectual property rights in this legislation, but rather referred to the general legislation – and thirdly, the provision of exact information to the authorities.I also wish to point out that we have set up a register. No feeding or admixing of components will now take place in the European Union without such components being published, as they must be included in the register. This is important not only to the supervisory authorities but also to the public and to customers. From the point of view of the rapporteur, therefore, I can say that I am very satisfied with the result overall.

3, 3. The placing on the market and use of feed for animals (debate) ,"  Androulla Vassiliou,  Member of the Commission. − Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for its work on this dossier, and especially the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs, who all played an important role.Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has managed to steer discussions during the negotiations with great skill, and we are very grateful to him.The compromise package maintains the high level of feed safety achieved in the EU. It strikes the right balance between consumer protection and intellectual property rights. It removes the burden of the pre-market authorisation procedure for bio-proteins, modernises the labelling of feed through proper information for the customer and places coregulation at the heart of legislative procedures. It improves market transparency through the notification system for new feed materials, facilitates innovation and competitiveness in the EU feed business and marks a concrete step against the misleading of feed users – be they farmers or pet owners.The result of the negotiations is the compromise package submitted for your vote, which amounts to simplification and modernisation of the current legal framework. The provisions concerning the so-called ‘open declaration’ allow for a more modern type of labelling. Feed materials incorporated into compound feed for food-producing animals will have to be labelled by weight, in descending order.On top of this, the exact percentage of weight has to be indicated for highlighted feed materials, and in the case of voluntary labelling.Furthermore, the provision that certain information concerning compound feed can be transferred from the competent authorities to the purchasers on grounds of urgency improves the appropriate information to the user in cases such as feed contamination incidents.In this context, the Commission makes the following declarations. First, in order to adapt Annex III on the tolerances for the compositional labelling of feed materials and compound feed to scientific and technical development, the Commission and its services envisage taking up examination of that Annex. In this context, the Commission will also consider certain feed materials with a moisture content in excess of 50%.Second, with regard to the labelling of additives, the Commission will study whether the principles of information through labelling of feed could also apply to the additives and premixtures authorised under the Regulation on additives for use in animal nutrition.Finally, the Commission understands that any urgencies relating to human and animal health and the environment may include urgencies generated, among other things, by negligence, international fraud or criminal acts.

I believe that the approach taken to this report is a model for the parliamentary work in this House.Today’s vote does not involve any amendments, as the work on this was technically very sound and encompassed the entire political spectrum. I believe that this result is one to be proud of. It is a balanced result that safeguards the interests of farmers as users of feed, feed manufacturers, and all other links in the food chain.It improves transparency, and my group, in particular, sets great store by the setting up of a register in which the raw materials mixed into feed must be entered. Food scandals occur time and again and not even the new legislation will prevent this, as no European rules are designed to prevent criminal activity; but these rules will help ensure that, when these scandals do occur, it will be easier to detect what substances have been mixed in.I also think it a good thing that manufacturers of feed may provide further information on a voluntary basis, and I consider it an excellent proposal that, if they provide such information, this must be scientifically proven. I am of the opinion that this new feed law significantly improves protection and that the decreasing order enables farmers to see the proportions of each feed component and what is the best feed for their animals, and to choose accordingly.I reiterate my thanks to all those who contributed to making this such a good report.

5, 3. The placing on the market and use of feed for animals (debate) ,"  Rosa Miguélez Ramos,  on behalf of the PSE Group. – (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, as I have already done in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups and also the Council for the work carried out.This work has allowed us to reach agreement at first reading and furthermore, has been an excellent running-in process for the codecision procedure that will be standard practice in our committee in the near future.Ladies and gentlemen, at present, legislation on the movement of raw materials for feed and compound feed for animals, including pets – a sector that represents some EUR 50 billion in trade at Community level – is regulated by several directives and some 50 amendments and implementing acts.The simplification of the legislation and its harmonised application are the main objectives that will doubtless be achieved by this Regulation.Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has already debated the placing on the market of animal feed, back in 2006. We will all recall that we unanimously asked the European Commission, in future review, to endeavour to find a fair balance between the interests of farmers in obtaining detailed information on feed ingredients and the interests of the industry in ensuring sufficient protection of its know-how.The compromise reached on the main sensitive points of the Commission’s proposal, the open declaration of raw materials and the creation of a Community list of raw materials, is a good reflection, in my opinion, of this balance. Proof of this is the welcome the compromise has received from all those involved.In fact, by means of the open declaration, the compromise protects the rights of purchasers to be informed and of manufacturers to retain ownership of their know-how by indicating that information should be provided without prejudice to the 2004 Directive on intellectual property rights.There is no question, ladies and gentlemen, that in a relationship of trust between supplier and user, the formulae should be known, but it would not be logical to be obliged to give the recipe to the first client who came through the door. Many of us have drunk Coca-Cola for many years. Although we do not know its recipe, this does not mean that we doubt that the product’s characteristics are observed and that health standards are respected.The Court of Justice judgment previously mentioned strictly establishes that the obligation to inform customers of the exact composition of feed, if they so request, is not justified by a desired aim to protect health.That said, I must remind you that the competent authority will have access to the precise composition at all times and, as established in the compromise reached, any emergency related to human or animal health or the environment will mean that the purchasers will have access to precise information on the composition of the feed in question once the legitimate interests of both the manufacturers and the purchasers have been considered.With regard to the list of good labelling practices, this remains voluntary for the professionals in the sector without at any time becoming a positive list of raw materials for the manufacture of compound feeds, as this is something that has not been requested.The legislation will include, at the European Parliament’s request, a new annex comprising a list of raw materials for animal feed of which the placing on the market or use is prohibited or restricted. This is information, whether an annex or a list, that the Commission can update.The Socialist Group in the European Parliament, whom I represent, supports the compromise reached and has not tabled any amendments for the plenary. We are fully in favour of the position as presented today in this House and, as such, we will vote in favour of it.

6, 3.

The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe shares the view that the compromise that has been struck is a good one, and so we will be able to vote in favour of it later today.What matters most is for the intellectual property of the cattle feed manufacturers to be safeguarded. If we in the sector want innovation – as indeed, yesterday, we voted on a climate report – there is much room for improvement in the cattle feed sector too, so that the emission of all kinds of gases caused by livestock can be reduced. Well, this is a challenge we need to confront squarely. When cattle feed manufacturers decide to innovate, they should not be impeded by excessively strict legislation on disclosure. This disclosure is, to my mind, safeguarded, as others have already mentioned, and could be done at the request of the government or a certain customer, for example. There is nothing stopping the cattle feed manufacturers from doing this on a voluntary basis.The ingredients as such are not the most important thing: the precise nutritional value of cattle feed is much more important, and should be correctly labelled. Everything that is on the label, such as energy, protein, and suchlike, is valuable information. In short, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will be backing this compromise. We will also say to the cattle feed manufacturers that if they wish to innovate in their production processes and their cattle feed composition, for example, this is a good compromise that will help them do this.

7, 3. The placing on the market and use of feed for animals (debate) ,"  Andrzej Tomasz Zapałowski,  on behalf of the UEN Group. – (PL) Mr President, the market for feedstuffs and their use in animal production is extremely important, because it concerns the health of hundreds of millions of citizens in EU Member States.Unpleasant experiences from the past in the form of animal diseases caused by unsuitable feedstuffs brought about huge material and social costs in the countries of the Community. This is why defining the composition of feeds is also extremely important, in order to limit the use of improper feeds. Effective enforcement of the provisions contained in the regulation is also important, so that they will not be merely hollow declarations.Currently, when millions of people and even entire countries in Europe are against the consumption of food produced using animal feeds which contain genetically modified plants, those people have the right to know what is happening. Therefore, it is not only farmers who should be informed about the contents of animal feed, but food processing plants should inform customers about this on product labels. And this is not being done.Several months ago in this Chamber, we debated the increasing numbers of obese people in Europe. This problem, however, in great measure concerns precisely the contents of animal feeds, because it is these contents which significantly affect the quality of meat. It is very good that in the draft regulation, much attention has been paid to the hygiene of feed production and to the problem of the addition of contaminated materials during production. That practice has sometimes been used by many producers.

He has also displayed the wisdom of Solomon in striking a balance between the needs of the consumers and the very legitimate needs of manufacturers for the protection of their product and their intellectual property.This is what I would call back home one of the more classic European Parliament dossiers. Looking at our guests in the visitors’ gallery, it is pretty safe to say that animal feed labelling is probably not one of the most glamorous subjects they could have heard us talking about today, but it is crucially important and it is a real example of where this Parliament adds value, and where we can ensure our consumers’, our citizens’ and our voters’ faith in the food chain of the food they eat.It is important to remember where this issue came from.

9, 3. The placing on the market and use of feed for animals (debate) ,"  Witold Tomczak,  on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. – (PL) Mr President, the compromise achieved concerning feedstuffs does have certain advantages – it harmonises and simplifies EU legislation – but it also has fundamental flaws: it does not offer sufficient guarantee of the safety of animal feeds and of foods, it affords weak protection of the interests of the five million farmers who breed and raise animals, and it does not sufficiently protect our health.The access of animal feed users to information about the contents of the feed will still be limited by the protection of intellectual property rights. If the producer of a feedstuff uses a dangerous ingredient, we will still be vulnerable. The problem of feedstuffs is further proof of the mistaken direction being taken by agricultural policy which, in spite of declarations, supports industrial agriculture first and foremost and, in such agriculture, farmers do not have to have their own feedstuffs and can raise animals using feedstuffs produced by specialised businesses. These businesses are, of course, profit-driven and will always find a way to reduce costs, but will not necessarily take into account the safety of animals or our health. As a consequence, we have to multiply specific provisions and increase monitoring, which takes the matter to an absurd level.Is it not time to reverse these tendencies and to return to the sustainable development of agriculture, in which farmers will have their own feedstuffs and will not be exposed to the losses caused by dioxins or BSE? Progress in agriculture does not have to mean the concentration of production or the concentration of feedstuff production. We should bear in mind that in the EU, we currently have 15 million farms, and as many as 95% of these are small and medium-sized farms.

If the producer of a feedstuff uses a dangerous ingredient, we will still be vulnerable. The problem of feedstuffs is further proof of the mistaken direction being taken by agricultural policy which, in spite of declarations, supports industrial agriculture first and foremost and, in such agriculture, farmers do not have to have their own feedstuffs and can raise animals using feedstuffs produced by specialised businesses. These businesses are, of course, profit-driven and will always find a way to reduce costs, but will not necessarily take into account the safety of animals or our health. As a consequence, we have to multiply specific provisions and increase monitoring, which takes the matter to an absurd level.', 'Is it not time to reverse these tendencies and to return to the sustainable development of agriculture, in which farmers will have their own feedstuffs and will not be exposed to the losses caused by dioxins or BSE? Progress in agriculture does not have to mean the concentration of production or the concentration of feedstuff production. We should bear in mind that in the EU, we currently have 15 million farms, and as many as 95% of these are small and medium-sized farms. Most of these farms can use the sustainable model of agriculture for the good of farmers, the environment and of us all.

10, 3. The placing on the market and use of feed for animals (debate) ,"  Jean-Claude Martinez  (NI).   – (FR) Mr President, what is good about animals is that the years go by and the problems remain the same. For example, we always mention jaw traps when talking about wild animals, and the question of transport, breeding and feed always arises in relation to farm animals. Animal feed is a classic case; it is a mishmash, a load of rubbish. Antibiotics, clenbuterol, growth hormones, even the remains of other animals, are used, and this is what the United Kingdom’s contaminated feed problem from the 1990s was all about.However, today we are told that the junk-food era is over. There has been a 2002 directive and a 2005 Court of Justice ruling and, now, there is the desire to reconcile the market and profit – which is referred to as intellectual property – with consumer safety.Thus, here we find ourselves today armed with a regulation. Using the classic tool of labelling, all the components are going to be indicated, in descending order of weight, and there will also be an open declaration, an Annex III and a tolerance of +/-15%. Moreover, the most inquisitive among us will even be able to request the exact composition.Only two big questions remain. The first concerns imported animals which have not been labelled. Mr Parish is here; he has taken a great interest in animals arriving from Brazil, which are not marked and which have been fed clenbuterol. When it comes to the safety of these animals, we do not know a great deal.And then there remains the big question of imported feed, namely raw materials that have been arriving from the American continent since the 1960s. In the 1960s, this came in the form of corn gluten feed – molasses, oilseed residues – and, today, it is in the form of transgenic soya from Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil, and transgenic maize from Canada and the United States. And this, dare I say it, because people are against local GMOs, but not immigrant GMOs.The fact is, we are talking here about two-thirds of the feed of our herds, and that is a real health issue. The single issue of European health security is obscuring the wider issue of global health risks, due to the Uruguay Round agreement and the Blair House agreement, which oblige us to import our oilseeds to feed two-thirds of our herds.

If you have looked recently at the problems that we have had in Europe – and we have had problems in various countries with animal feed – this is not because the labelling system and the processes have been wrong, but because companies have broken the law.Therefore, we must ensure not only that we get this law right but also that the Commission and Member States monitor this law and inspect the feed companies to make sure that they are not breaking the rules, because, again, people and consumers must have confidence in our food.I would say to you that European food is as safe as we can get it, but we must never let up, to make sure that our consumers are absolutely satisfied that what they are eating is safe.

The type of production and the type of controls on production are the most important prerequisites for this report, to ensure that ultimately, we have healthy, safe feed from which to produce healthy, safe food.I should like to reiterate my conviction that businesses that also process food to make feed should be subject to better scrutiny, that the HACCP concept should be required as a basis for authorisation – possibly for authorisation throughout Europe – as that has also been a problem in both yesterday’s and today’s debates. We need the same controls for the same risks throughout the European Union. Although we can never rule out abuses, this report and also yesterday’s debate have laid good foundations for safety without going over the top.

20, 3. The placing on the market and use of feed for animals (debate) ,"  Véronique Mathieu  (PPE-DE).   – (FR) Mr President, the excellent report by our fellow Member – whom I congratulate – on which we are going to vote today, is important because the European animal feed sector is one of our main agricultural sectors, both in terms of production, since it accounts for half of the agricultural production within the European Union – 120 million tonnes – and of turnover – around EUR 50 billion. Within the European Union, there are, in fact, 5 million farmers and 60 million pet-owning households.In the past, the European Union has come to terms with a number of health crises, which means that, today, we have to be more vigilant with regard to transparency, in order to meet the expectations not only of farmers, but also of consumers. The provisions laid down in this report have the advantage of representing a minimal cost for the industries and a great benefit for consumers, who are paying more and more attention to the quality of the goods they buy. Adopting this report will make it possible to limit the risks by guaranteeing better quality goods, better monitoring, more traceability, and better information for farmers and, therefore, ultimately, for consumers.Today, with the increase in international trade, it is vitally important to strengthen all prevention systems, so as to ensure that the food crises that we have experienced in the past do not happen again.This report succeeds in reconciling the right to information, while strictly defining the nutritional elements that must appear on the labels, with the right to intellectual property, which is so important when it comes to preserving the competitiveness of our industries.I believe that manufacturers should actually be obliged to give immediate notification of the use of any new raw material going into animal feed, in order to guarantee transparency and to facilitate the inspections performed by the competent authorities. Including an urgency procedure that enables a new dangerous substance to be incorporated into the list of prohibited materials seems altogether crucial to me.Equally, giving farmers the opportunity to question the competent national authority or the European Commission in case of doubt about an unfair allegation enables the system to be controlled better and customers to be protected, while fair trading is also preserved.I therefore wish to offer my full support to this excellent report, for experience shows that a regulation on the labelling of animal feed that prioritises quality, transparency, traceability and monitoring is the best means of preventing further health crises in Europe.

First of all, on the question of safety, safety of feed is guaranteed by the negative list of feed materials which cannot be used in feeds. The proposal contains the list of feed materials which are forbidden. The Commission will extend that list every time it is convinced that it is necessary to add to that negative list.On the other hand, I wish to remind you that there is a large list of maximum levels of contaminants, such as dangerous micro-toxins, heavy metals and dioxins, which has been in force, under the Directive on undesirable substances, since 2002.I would agree with all those who said, as I confirmed, that European food is safe. However, as I also indicated last night during our discussions, laws and regulations are as good as we make them, and we therefore have to remain vigilant and see to it that Member States, feed dealers and, indeed, the Commission, ensure that everybody sticks to their obligations in ensuring that laws really are enforced and that they are good laws.The recent Irish meat incident highlights the need for stringent enforcement and controls on legal requirements, and my services will continue to examine how that can be improved. I am confident that, once the new rules come into force, regulation of the feed market will be significantly improved, in the interests of both feed manufacturers and users.Last but not least, I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for his excellent contribution, and all Members for their constructive and positive role in reaching an agreement on this important initiative.

I believe this is a good report.On the subject of whether criminal activity can be prevented, this report cannot do so, of course, but the improved intensity of controls it provides may deter such activity. Criminal activity always focuses where it sees an opportunity, where it sees loopholes, and we have now been able to close these in some areas. I hope – as Mr Nicholson said – that both the feed industry and farmers will understand that there is something to be defended here, that a community is being formed against these attempts to dispose of toxic substances via feed. I am fairly sure that this will also curb criminal activity.I should like to make clear once more that we are not creating a separate line for intellectual property here, but rather making reference to the legislation already in force, which also applies to this field. We wanted to prevent the duty of information from hiding behind these intellectual property rights. That is why this is a good arrangement.Let me conclude by thanking the shadow rapporteurs.

31, 4. Information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products (debate) ,"  Constantin Dumitriu,  rapporteur. – (RO) I am pleased that we have this opportunity to debate in a plenary session an issue which is important not only for the Community’s agricultural sector, but also for the European economy’s competitiveness as a whole.At a time when the economies of our countries are suffering as a result of the global crisis and when increasing the demand for agricultural products is an imperative, amending Regulation No 3/2008 on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries offers us additional leverage to support agricultural producers and, by extension, the EU economy.European Council Regulation No 3/2008, which combines in a single text regulations 2702/1999 and 2826/2000, has accommodated the European Commission’s new political approaches on simplifying legislation, while also achieving the objective of facilitating administrative procedures within the European institutions. Based on this regulation, the Community can take information provision measures for a certain number of agricultural products on the internal market and on the markets of third countries, while also preserving the specific nature of the measures, according to the market in which they are implemented.This policy provides a response to a real need on the part of Member States to promote the image of their agricultural products, especially the benefits in terms of quality, nutritional value and food safety standards, both among European consumers and consumers in other countries. It also helps open up new market outlets and has a multiplier effect for national and private sector initiatives.The amendments initiated by the European Commission are aimed at allowing interested Member States to devise a relevant programme where the organisations involved in drawing up proposals do not wish to present programmes to be implemented in third countries. As a result of this, Member States will have the opportunity to expand the area of application of the measures targeted by these programmes and also seek the assistance of international organisations in implementing these measures. The draft report we are discussing proposes certain additions and adaptations to the Commission proposal, which are necessary in order to clarify and supplement the logic of the regulation.First of all, we are proposing to introduce consultations with professional associations and organisations operating in the target sectors of the Member States, which are involved in the process of devising information programmes for agricultural products, both on the internal market and in third countries. In view of their expertise and the important role these associations and organisations also play in guaranteeing and controlling quality, it is absolutely paramount that they are consulted. At the same time, we support these programmes being drawn up based on an assessment of the need for them and their timeliness, providing us with the assurance that the funds are being spent effectively in programmes which meet the objective of helping promote Community products.We are also proposing to extend the areas where international organisations can be assigned the implementation of information programmes for third countries. Promotion and publicity measures are also relevant to the wine sector, both on the EU internal market and in third countries. As is the case with the olive oil and table olive sector, international bodies exist in the wine sector, such as the International Organisation of Vine and Wine, which can ensure the implementation in third countries of programmes proposed by Member States, thereby disseminating information about the characteristics and advantages of wines with a protected designation of origin and those with a protected geographical indication.Another amendment which we are proposing to you is aimed at increasing the European Union’s cofinancing percentage from 60% to 70% at a time when it is increasingly more difficult for small producers to gain access to financing due to the financial crisis. Without any financial support, they risk going bankrupt as they do not have the leverage to promote their products and are facing a drop in market demand.The ultimate aim of these proposals is to generate greater market demand in order to boost production and support the European economy as a whole. Attaining this goal will help us overcome these difficult times we are going through. The quality of the European Union’s agricultural and food products is an advantage which we need to utilise in order to guarantee the European economy’s competitiveness and higher incomes for producers.I hope that the recommendations we are going to adopt will be implemented as soon as possible by the European Commission and Member States because we cannot afford to waste time in such circumstances when European citizens are being hit by the effects of an extremely deep economic recession. The measures being proposed will obviously not resolve all the problems linked to marketing and promoting the Community’s agricultural and food products.Simplifying the red tape involved with registering traditional products, introducing a ‘Made in the European Union’ label and solving the problem of products imported from third countries of lower quality and safety standards are just some of the areas which we need to consider in order to boost the market share for Community products. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your comments and questions.

It also helps open up new market outlets and has a multiplier effect for national and private sector initiatives.', 'The amendments initiated by the European Commission are aimed at allowing interested Member States to devise a relevant programme where the organisations involved in drawing up proposals do not wish to present programmes to be implemented in third countries. As a result of this, Member States will have the opportunity to expand the area of application of the measures targeted by these programmes and also seek the assistance of international organisations in implementing these measures. The draft report we are discussing proposes certain additions and adaptations to the Commission proposal, which are necessary in order to clarify and supplement the logic of the regulation.', 'First of all, we are proposing to introduce consultations with professional associations and organisations operating in the target sectors of the Member States, which are involved in the process of devising information programmes for agricultural products, both on the internal market and in third countries. In view of their expertise and the important role these associations and organisations also play in guaranteeing and controlling quality, it is absolutely paramount that they are consulted. At the same time, we support these programmes being drawn up based on an assessment of the need for them and their timeliness, providing us with the assurance that the funds are being spent effectively in programmes which meet the objective of helping promote Community products.', 'We are also proposing to extend the areas where international organisations can be assigned the implementation of information programmes for third countries. Promotion and publicity measures are also relevant to the wine sector, both on the EU internal market and in third countries. As is the case with the olive oil and table olive sector, international bodies exist in the wine sector, such as the International Organisation of Vine and Wine, which can ensure the implementation in third countries of programmes proposed by Member States, thereby disseminating information about the characteristics and advantages of wines with a protected designation of origin and those with a protected geographical indication.', 'Another amendment which we are proposing to you is aimed at increasing the European Union’s cofinancing percentage from 60% to 70% at a time when it is increasingly more difficult for small producers to gain access to financing due to the financial crisis. Without any financial support, they risk going bankrupt as they do not have the leverage to promote their products and are facing a drop in market demand.', 'The ultimate aim of these proposals is to generate greater market demand in order to boost production and support the European economy as a whole. Attaining this goal will help us overcome these difficult times we are going through. The quality of the European Union’s agricultural and food products is an advantage which we need to utilise in order to guarantee the European economy’s competitiveness and higher incomes for producers.', 'I hope that the recommendations we are going to adopt will be implemented as soon as possible by the European Commission and Member States because we cannot afford to waste time in such circumstances when European citizens are being hit by the effects of an extremely deep economic recession. The measures being proposed will obviously not resolve all the problems linked to marketing and promoting the Community’s agricultural and food products.', 'Simplifying the red tape involved with registering traditional products, introducing a ‘Made in the European Union’ label and solving the problem of products imported from third countries of lower quality and safety standards are just some of the areas which we need to consider in order to boost the market share for Community products. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your comments and questions. ']"

33, 4. Information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products (debate) ,"  Mariann Fischer Boel,  Member of the Commission. − Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dumitriu, and the members of the Agriculture Committee, for an excellent report on the Commission proposal on information and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal and external markets.I would like to stress the importance of the issues addressed in this report. I think we all agree that the promotion of European agricultural products is of huge importance, both internally and externally. I am convinced that trade in agricultural products will continue to grow in the future – even if we have to admit that we face a setback at the present time owing to the economic crisis. However, there will be huge opportunities for our European products in third-country markets, and our promotion campaign should help European producers explore those new markets.Before going into the content of the report, I would like to put it into perspective. In 2008, the Commission adopted 42 programmes on the internal market and on third countries, representing a budget of EUR 128 million over three years. According to the rules, half of that amount was then to be financed by the Community.The aim of the Commission proposal is to make it possible for Member States to launch programmes cofinanced by the European Union in third countries – as described by the rapporteur – because today this possibility only exists for the internal market. It should also be possible for those programmes to be implemented by international organisations.The three most important amendments from the rapporteur and his colleagues are as follows: firstly, to make it compulsory for Member States to consult trade associations about the proposed programmes; secondly, to specify that implementation by international organisations is not only a possibility reserved for the International Olive Oil Council, but a general possibility, for example – as mentioned here today – also in the wine sector; and, on the budget side, to increase the cofinancing rate.With regard to those amendments, I would emphasise that Member States do, in fact, already consult trade associations in order to make sure that they have the support of producers. I would prefer that partnership approach to continue on a voluntary basis.My mentioning of the International Olive Oil Council is only meant as an example, because of the discussions that have recently taken place on the whole olive oil sector. It certainly does not exclude other international organisations, such as the International Organisation of Vine and Wine.Regarding the funding of the budget, there is, of course, ongoing discussion on the level of cofinancing by the Community, but we discussed this issue when merging the two regulations dealing with promotion and information in 2008, so I do not think we should re-open the discussion on this issue.Could I just take the opportunity to say that, when we agreed the wine reform, we did recognise the importance of promoting our products on third-country markets. Therefore, in the interests of spending the budget for wine in a smarter and more intelligent way, we proposed the earmarking of EUR 120 million each year for the promotion of our wine products on third country markets as a special budget line. However, since Member States – and especially the new Member States – did not want to be in a position where that money was earmarked in such a way that, if it was not spent, then it was lost, we included the EUR 120 million in the national envelopes, so that Member States can decide for themselves. In any case, this gives a clear signal that the Community does care and does recognise the importance of strong promotion of our European products. I look forward to the discussion here today.

35, 4. Information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products (debate) ,"  Bogdan Golik,  on behalf of the PSE Group. – (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I sincerely congratulate Mr Dumitriu on a good report – a continuation of the reports which were drawn up earlier, in which we talked about promotion and sums of money allocated to promotion of the European Union in third countries.Information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries play an enormous role in creating a positive image of the ‘Made in Europe’ brand. I have been stressing this for a long time, and for several years I have been active in efforts to simplify the entire information provision and promotion system. In my speeches I have repeatedly stressed the necessity of promoting the ‘Made in Europe’ brand in third-country markets. This is especially legitimate in the formal and legal conditions of today.In accordance with the Declaration of the Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, the use of all forms of export subsidies and disciplines on all export measures with equivalent effect will be eliminated in 2013. In view of the complicated nature of organising promotional campaigns in third-country markets and the higher costs of such measures at a significant distance, particularly in Asia or America, the mechanism for supporting promotional activities did not attract much interest from trade organisations.The proposal of the European Commission allows for stimulation of their activity. Promotional programmes carried out by Member States offer the opportunity for entities to work together, where they have not managed to run and finance these activities on their own. Nevertheless, efforts to increase the percentage share of the Community in financing this type of project should be continued. I will mention as an example the United States of America, where several times more is spent on promotional activities than all the money allocated to wine and to activities in the area of other promotional products in the entire European Union.In the face of liberalisation of the commercial flow of agricultural products, an instrument to support the promotion of Community production in third-country markets might be the only tool available which accords with the guidelines of the Agriculture Framework Agreement in the WTO Doha Development Agenda Round. Promotion of the ‘Made in Europe’ brand is the chance to maintain competitiveness and, on a longer time-scale, even to strengthen the attractiveness of European agricultural and food products and to extend their market.I would like to thank the Commission for these measures, which we have repeatedly spoken of in Parliament, and which have been included, and especially for the reduction in contributions from trade organisations from 20% to 10% and for increasing the funds available for promotional activity.

Yet advertising comes about not only as a result of professional offensives but also of occurrences in the region from which the foodstuffs originate.When the world associates us with BSE, when we have turned our heraldic animal mad, or when, as now, countries are issuing product recalls because of the dioxin problem – which, of course, is also going around the world – and when millions of slaughtered sick cattle are shown on television news around the world, this is also a kind of advertising: negative advertising.We must be careful to avoid contradiction here. On the one hand, there is our talk of good products but, on the other, there are the negative reports – but we are working on this, as we have just seen with the debate and what we have concluded.If we wish to advertise externally – yes, that is right, we have good reason to do so, as we have good products – I do not want it to be generalised advertising, but advertising showing European diversity. As you know, we have the situation in Germany where the Federal Constitutional Court has ruled against a kind of compulsory advertising with a compulsory levy. It pointed out that advertising that does not differentiate between the individual qualities does not increase sales, and that instead, it is important that the individual producers be able to advertise for their specific products.In addition, it is increasingly important – not only within Europe but also externally – to describe not only the quality of the end product but also the quality of the process. What is the situation with regard to animal protection, to the environment, to the ingredients, to the structure of the farming, to fair trade? These are all criteria that do not necessarily affect the quality of the end product, but are becoming increasingly important to consumers.

The percentage rate of the European Union’s financial participation needs to be increased in order to provide additional support for the projects selected by Member States, at a time of a general tightening of the conditions in which national organisations and authorities seek to obtain the amounts they must contribute to cofinancing.I support the idea that the organisation tasked with implementing the selected programme should be an international organisation, especially where the programme is aiming to promote the olive oil and table olive sector, not to mention the sector for wines with a protected designation of origin and those with a protected geographical indication in third countries.At the same time, we must bear in mind the important role which professional associations and organisations operating in the target sectors of the Member States have in devising information programmes for agricultural products.

That is why we must offer them all the help we can, so that the richness and quality of our produce is not lost and does not become ironed out in an ever-more homogeneous global market. For this reason, I support the rapporteur’s amendments, which are aimed at increasing Commission cofinancing, adding to the activities that can be funded and, most importantly, increasing participation in producers’ associations, which are best-placed to defend the qualitative features of their produce to ever-more exacting consumers.

As the rapporteur himself has emphasised, the quality and safety of European products provide a competitive edge which has not been sufficiently utilised yet.Measures aimed at providing information about and promoting these products, their quality and the food safety standards they comply with may trigger a chain reaction by boosting demand, increasing farmers’ production and profits and creating new jobs, which also implicitly means economic growth. These measures must be directed equally at consumers in the internal market and those in third countries.Let us not forget the competition we are facing on the internal market from producers from other countries, offering products which are sometimes cheaper, but where, very often, the quality and safety standards are much lower. Consumers need to recognise Community products and know why they are healthier than others. Last but not least, they must know that buying these products supports European farmers and agri-food producers and, therefore, the European economy.I particularly appreciate the initiative from the rapporteur on recognising the important role which professional associations and organisations play because, in most cases, they have the expertise which the country’s institutions do not have. They are also much more familiar with the real situation on the market and its requirements. At the same time, I think that the proposal to increase the cofinancing percentage is an absolute necessity in the current credit crisis.

First of all on the financing – this has been raised by quite a few of you – to increase the cofinancing rate.

That would be a bad outcome and that is the reason why we have maintained our proposal.Quality has been mentioned quite a few times today and I agree with you. I think we have a golden opportunity to discuss this quality issue that is also linked to how we promote our products in the Third World, how we explain to consumers what they get when they buy European.Last October, we presented a Green Paper on quality and we have had lots of contributions; there are more than 1 000 contributions on the website from all over Europe. We are now digesting all these different ideas and we will present a communication in May. We should take this opportunity when the discussion takes place here in Parliament on communication to make a link – how do we improve our possibilities to make it visible and make it understandable.

53, 4. Information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products (debate) ,"  Constantin Dumitriu,  rapporteur. – (RO) I wish to apologise if I run over my allotted two minutes by a few seconds. Thank you for the extremely relevant comments and views you have expressed about this report. I am confident that our remaining fellow Members will consider that the new regulations being proposed are appropriate and that we will vote in favour of them.I would like to advise fellow Members that I will support their suggestions, especially those aimed at promoting European diversity, introducing European quality labelling and more consistent financial support from the Community. I have been asked: why wine, along with olive oil among the international organisations which can implement promotion projects? I would like to respond with another question: why olive oil then? My response is positive on both counts. They are highly successful export products from European Union Member States. They have powerful, experienced international organisations which have already demonstrated their ability to manage complex programmes. Indeed, the report’s provisions do not exclude other areas. As regards the second question about the 70% rate for cofinancing, the initial percentage rate was 60% and I felt that, in the current economic climate, it was necessary to increase it.As experience from the uptake of European funds has shown so far, one of the biggest problems remains how to obtain cofinancing, especially at the moment when we are faced, on top of this, with a credit crisis. This is why this rate needs to be increased, otherwise we risk ending up with the funds not being used. Mrs Fischer Boel, I would like to thank you for the importance you have given to this report, in particular for the views you have expressed. Although this is a consultation report, I hope and I would like these amendments to be included in the Commission’s new proposal.To finally sum up, there are two reasons why this report is necessary. Member States will have the opportunity to expand the area of application of the measures targeted by these programmes and seek assistance from the international organisations in implementing these measures. It assigns a greater role to professional organisations and associations in the process of drawing up and implementing product information and promotion programmes. Last but not least, it is part of the logic of the proposals for adapting European legislation in order to make the use of European funds more accessible by increasing the cofinancing percentage rate during a time when it is extremely difficult to gain access to credit. As a further recommendation, I would also like to mention that the report was adopted unanimously by the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the Committee for the support they provided. I would personally like to thank Neil Parish for the support he gave me and, last but not least, Lutz Goepel for the trust he placed in me when he assigned me this report.

They have powerful, experienced international organisations which have already demonstrated their ability to manage complex programmes. Indeed, the report’s provisions do not exclude other areas. As regards the second question about the 70% rate for cofinancing, the initial percentage rate was 60% and I felt that, in the current economic climate, it was necessary to increase it.', 'As experience from the uptake of European funds has shown so far, one of the biggest problems remains how to obtain cofinancing, especially at the moment when we are faced, on top of this, with a credit crisis. This is why this rate needs to be increased, otherwise we risk ending up with the funds not being used. Mrs Fischer Boel, I would like to thank you for the importance you have given to this report, in particular for the views you have expressed. Although this is a consultation report, I hope and I would like these amendments to be included in the Commission’s new proposal.', 'To finally sum up, there are two reasons why this report is necessary. Member States will have the opportunity to expand the area of application of the measures targeted by these programmes and seek assistance from the international organisations in implementing these measures. It assigns a greater role to professional organisations and associations in the process of drawing up and implementing product information and promotion programmes. Last but not least, it is part of the logic of the proposals for adapting European legislation in order to make the use of European funds more accessible by increasing the cofinancing percentage rate during a time when it is extremely difficult to gain access to credit. As a further recommendation, I would also like to mention that the report was adopted unanimously by the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.', 'I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the Committee for the support they provided. I would personally like to thank Neil Parish for the support he gave me and, last but not least, Lutz Goepel for the trust he placed in me when he assigned me this report. ']"

Overall, it was a very balanced report and I am very pleased that the rapporteur, on the whole, was able to stick to the issue – which was trade – rather than focus on a number of other issues that I know a number of colleagues wanted her to focus on.However, I did have one major concern about this report, which was the reference to trade defence instruments. We have to recognise that consumers in my country – Britain – and in many other countries across the European Union, have benefited from open trade with China. It helped us at the time to fight perils such as inflation. However, protecting uncompetitive EU producers at the expense of other parties who benefit is something that we should tackle with care. We should make sure that we get the right balance and do not ignore the benefits of trade with China for consumers, companies with globalised supply chains and the retail sector.

Overall, it was a very balanced report and I am very pleased that the rapporteur, on the whole, was able to stick to the issue – which was trade – rather than focus on a number of other issues that I know a number of colleagues wanted her to focus on.', 'However, I did have one major concern about this report, which was the reference to trade defence instruments. We have to recognise that consumers in my country – Britain – and in many other countries across the European Union, have benefited from open trade with China. It helped us at the time to fight perils such as inflation. However, protecting uncompetitive EU producers at the expense of other parties who benefit is something that we should tackle with care. We should make sure that we get the right balance and do not ignore the benefits of trade with China for consumers, companies with globalised supply chains and the retail sector. On the whole, trade with China is to be welcomed. Eventually, that will lead to all the other issues being tackled, such as better human rights and labour issues. ']"

The number of SMEs (up to 250 employees; turnover ≤ EUR 50 million) in the EU reaches 23 million, which comprises around 99% of all firms active in our market. Over 75 million people work in these SMEs.The calls directed to the Commission, Member States and regional and local authorities for effective support of these businesses, including unhindered access to loans, are therefore justified. In addition, trade needs to be made easier and bureaucratic export and import barriers need to be lifted.In relation to public procurement, whose complicated and not always unequivocal procedures hinder the access of SMEs, the market should be made more open, both inside the EU and in third countries. As I have shown in my report on innovation policy, the role of SMEs in this sector is difficult to overestimate. This is because they are more flexible and open to modern technologies and organisational methods.Special treatment is required for SMEs in the agriculture and food sector, where care needs to be taken over protection of the designations of origin of products, and imitations which are harmful to the health of consumers need to be resisted.

The Internet has allowed even the smallest companies access to a global market previously unthinkable only a few years ago, boosting trade and allowing the positive aspects of globalisation to come to light. It has opened up new markets and broken down barriers to trade.The report has rightly pointed out that, although there has been a rise in fraud and counterfeiting, this should not be attributed to the Internet itself, but rather regarded as an issue that existed before and that needs tackling in new and innovative ways, as long as this does not impinge on our civil liberties. It also points out that it should be viewed as an opportunity for cultural diversity rather than a threat. Finally, it recognises that liberalisation of services connected to the Internet, such as telecoms, has led to a boom in infrastructure investment, so I believe we should be cautious about applying further regulation on such industries, as the Commission seems intent on doing at the moment.

In view of the ever-growing number of Internet users, better regulation needs to be put in place in this expanding area. European policies must encourage e-commerce as an effective alternative to the conventional method of doing business and as a way of boosting cross-border trade within the EU.A series of Community measures is required to eliminate the potential obstacles hampering better use of the Internet for commercial purposes. This includes measures designed to discourage and prevent fraud and theft of personal data. These Community measures must also encourage users to have greater trust in the online environment.At the same time, Community standards must be defined for e-commerce transactions. The EU needs to facilitate the implementation of these standards, thereby offering e-commerce agents the opportunity to be recognised as reliable suppliers.Thanks to the global nature of the Internet and the opportunity to carry out beneficial commercial transactions with third countries, I hope that we will see progress too within the WTO in terms of promoting e-commerce worldwide.

In this plenary, debates on Kosovo are usually not about Kosovo itself, but mainly about the effect it has on the rest of the world.

This will complete the conversion of Kosovo to a Euro-NATO protectorate.The first bloody cycle of the break-up of Yugoslavia and the re-drawing of new borders is closing with the opening up of new wounds at Balkan and global level with the imperialist law of divide and rule, which will give rise to new tensions and interventions.The Communist Party of Greece voted against this unacceptable resolution, highlighting the need to step up the anti-imperialist fight and confront the EU and its policies by demanding that the Greek and all the Euro-NATO occupying armies leave Kosovo and the Balkans as a whole.

The fact is, bringing together senior decision makers from the Chinese leadership and their counterparts from the European Commission cannot adequately address issues of mutual concern, especially in the areas of investment, market access and intellectual property rights protection and other strategic issues related to trade.

Such a move would strengthen cross-straits trade, drive up quality standards in the region and elevate Taiwan on the international stage.The way that China has used its disagreements with Taiwan to play politics with matters of public health is to be deprecated.

153, 11.1. Situation in Sri Lanka,"  Charles Tannock,  author. − Madam President, Sri Lanka’s bloody civil war seems finally to be coming to a conclusion. The LTTE, which has been blacklisted by the EU as a terrorist organisation, must now surely lay down its arms and surrender. The EU and other Co-chairs have urged the LTTE to do so. The LTTE’s response will show us whether it really has the best interests of Tamils at heart.The LTTE is using its front organisations in Europe to maximum propaganda effect and raising money by extortion internationally. Some LTTE militants may even try to seek asylum within the European Union.Throughout this ferocious 26-year civil war, the LTTE has pioneered atrocious terrorist tactics, such as suicide bombings, that are now used in many other parts of the world – regrettably. The Sri Lankan army has had, therefore, to deploy all the means at its disposal to counteract this brutal insurgency. However, it is clear that the casualty figures claimed by the LTTE have been exaggerated. Some have now been withdrawn – for instance, the Agence Presse story of 300 civilians killed, after the supposed author denied authorship. Nevertheless, the death of civilians in a war zone is tragic whenever and wherever it occurs.Clearly, the Sri Lankan armed forces cannot claim an unblemished record either, but they have not sought to deliberately exploit civilians and put them in harm’s way, like the LTTE has allegedly done.If the war really is soon to be over, it is essential that Sri Lanka turn its attention now to post-conflict disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration. The marginalisation of Tamils, at the expense of the majority Sinhalese, needs to be addressed in an urgent and permanent manner in order to ensure a stable and sustainable multiethnic society with regional devolution.The EU should also ensure resources are put at Sri Lanka’s disposal to support post-conflict development. Although we should support the Government’s offer of amnesty for the majority of the LTTE, it is vital that no one responsible for the most serious war crimes is allowed to get away with impunity.

154, 11.1. Situation in Sri Lanka,"  Marios Matsakis,  author. − Madam President, Sri Lanka has been afflicted by internal fighting for decades. This tragic situation came about as a result of the armed conflict mainly between separatist insurgent forces in the north and the Sri Lankan army. During this fighting, thousands of innocent people were killed and injured and much destruction to property, infrastructure and the environment has been caused.This sorry state of affairs has been exacerbated in recent months mainly due to the Government’s large-scale military offensive against the Tamil Tigers. Reports coming out of Sri Lanka indicate that the situation in certain areas has, in recent weeks, deteriorated tragically, with hundreds of civilians displaced and caught up in the fighting. According to Amnesty International, there have been violations of international conventions and human rights by both Government and Tamil Tiger forces.Admittedly, it is very difficult in such circumstances to be absolutely sure as to who is to be blamed for some of the tragic events in Sri Lanka, but we must call on both sides to exercise restraint and to pay utmost attention and respect to innocent civilians, and to observe the conventions of war.Since the Sri Lankan Government has the upper hand in the situation and is the internationally-recognised authority in the country, our call must, by necessity and logic, go mostly to them. At the same time, we must call on the Tamil Tiger leaders to abide by the calls of the international community, take advantage of the Government’s offer of amnesty, renounce violence and seek to achieve their aims through political dialogue.We must also once again advise emphatically that fighting solves no problems, and that lasting peace and stability can only be achieved at the negotiating table, which will inevitably happen sooner or later. In these negotiations, compromises will have to be made by both sides and a solution found which will be for the benefit of the citizens of this beautiful country. We hope that through this resolution we will help to lessen the suffering of the Sri Lankan people and to bring about much-needed peace in that country.

On this side of the House, we attach the same importance to Sri Lanka and believe it deserved equal and proper discussion, but I regret that not one other group supported us in this stand.A short debate this afternoon with a handful of people on a Thursday is an insult to the thousands of people under attack and dying in the north of Sri Lanka. We wanted to call, as in the joint USA and UK declaration from Washington earlier this week, for an immediate and unconditional cease-fire by both sides, but the PPE refused to include that in the text.We wanted to condemn, unreservedly, the bombing of hospitals and aid workers, but Mr Van Orden, negotiating for the PPE, refused to condemn it. That is why it is not in the resolution before you. To him – and presumably to Dr Tannock as well – everything the Government of Sri Lanka says is a fact and just about every aid organisation on the ground, from the Red Cross to the UN, can be dismissed. Amnesty International today suggests the Sri Lankan army could be guilty of war crimes for its use of cluster bombs on a hospital – a 16-hour bombardment, according to Amnesty International.The PSE also wanted to condemn the murders of journalists and other media workers by government agents. Paragraph 4 of the resolution asks the Government – the very same Sri Lankan Government – to investigate their own serious human rights violations.Colleagues, some of you may want to associate yourselves and your groups with those kinds of sentiments, but we do not.

156, 11.1. Situation in Sri Lanka,"  Raül Romeva i Rueda,  author. − (ES) I would like to start by saying that the resolution finally agreed is absolutely not one that I would have drafted. I believe that it suffers from excessive complacency in relation to the government in Colombo. I fear that it is another case of simplification, criminalisation and continued persecution of a group by simply arguing that it is a terrorist group. In fact, things are much more complex.However, I do believe that the current situation is such that Parliament should send out clear messages about certain issues. For example, one of the key points that I consider important to emphasise is the Tokyo appeal on the need for both sides, namely the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) and the government, to understand that a cease-fire must be agreed to allow humanitarian aid to get through and for the wounded and ill to be evacuated.Secondly, I think that it is essential to remember that there cannot be a military solution, Mr Tannock. This cannot happen, it is simply impossible.Now is therefore the time to negotiate terms for the cessation of violence, demobilisation and disarmament. However, for this to occur, the government must stop seeking a military victory that merely prolongs the suffering of so many people.A goodwill gesture would be, for example, to allow independent media and humanitarian personnel to enter the north.Moreover, in relation to the Generalised System of Preferences Plus, the GSP Plus, I am one of those who think that it should never have been granted to a country such as Sri Lanka, given the serious and continuing breaches of fundamental human rights in the country, many of these breaches being instigated by government authorities. I think that we should seriously consider opening an in-depth debate on the relevance of applying this preferential framework and, above all, on the consequences that it has for many groups, including workers.For these reasons I call upon the European Commission to carry out an in situ investigation to establish the effects of the measure and to review it if necessary.

Fighting between government forces and the LTTE has further escalated. Large parts of the north have been brought under control and strongholds of the Tamil rebels have been taken.What human rights organisations in both Colombo and Jaffna told me at the time is unfortunately confirmed time and again: ‘war is an institution’. The humanitarian situation is alarming. There are refugees in their thousands. There is a lack of medical care and of food. Aid agencies must be given unrestricted access to the civilian population in a cease-fire to be agreed.

160, 11.1. Situation in Sri Lanka,"  Bernd Posselt  (PPE-DE).   – (DE) Madam President, the dramatic images from Sri Lanka reveal that a brutal civil war that has spanned decades is coming to a head. As we all know, whilst it may be possible to end a war by means of weapons, it is not possible to establish lasting peace this way. In addition, there can be no effective, lasting fight against terrorism, in particular, by means of weapons, as terrorism always finds a way. Therefore, it is important to get to grips with the causes.The next step must be to reach a peace settlement based on the following fundamental elements. Firstly, a clear monopoly of power on the part of the unitary State. No State can allow ethnic groups or sections of the population to arm and engage in armed conflict. This requires, however, that this State comply with democratic rules and the rule of law and actively seek a political solution along the lines of autonomy, one that finally resolves Sri Lanka’s nationality problems, which are an old historical legacy and also a legacy of colonial times, and which need to be tackled urgently.Therefore, I wish to appeal quite clearly to the European Union and all the countries of this earth to help with the development of democracy and the rule of law, with the strengthening of autonomy and of minority rights, and of course also with the economic development of a country that has been bled dry so appallingly by the terror of this civil war.Therefore, if the guns were to fall silent at long last – unfortunately we are not at that stage yet – this would not mean the end of developments, but only the beginning of movement towards a peace based on the rule of law, freedom, human rights, minority rights and national autonomy.

169, 11.2. Situation of Burmese refugees in Thailand,"  Erik Meijer,  author. − (NL) Madam President, Burma is known as a violent military dictatorship in which a caste of profiteers has been able to hang onto power for many years. Oppression and poverty have caused many people to flee the country, or to try to do so.The country’s ethnic diversity both justifies and reinforces this dictatorship. In large areas, minority peoples are in the majority. They pursue autonomy and organise protests against the central dictatorship. The military leaders consider their dictatorship necessary to be able to keep the country together permanently and to subjugate the rebellious people. They are more interested in the territory than in the people who live in it. By issuing major exploitation concessions to foreign businesses, vital sources of income are taken from the indigenous people, with nature and the environment being seriously damaged in the process.The need to flee the country is further reinforced by the fact that no consideration is given to the regional majority peoples. The regime is keen to eliminate troublesome groups, either by killing them or by chasing them out of the country. Many flee into the sea in makeshift dinghies, running the considerable risk of drowning. Burma’s neighbour, Thailand, has seen many refugees cross the border: according to some estimates, as many as two million people have fled over the past 25 years, and tens of thousands who have been refused entry remain homeless in the no man’s land along the border.Unfortunately, feelings of sympathy or solidarity with refugees are even less well developed in South East Asia than they are in Europe. Very often, refugees are sent home, even if this means certain death. Public opinion shows little interest, even if it involves people who share their religion, such as the Muslim boat refugees who ended up in Indonesia from Burma.Governments also give priority to good relations with their colleagues in dictatorial states, instead of bringing pressure to bear in order to improve the situation there. Some in Europe even tend towards adopting a similar attitude, and we can see the disastrous impact this has in Asia. This is another reason why we should urge the Asian countries to find a solution.

We in this House are well aware of the plight of the people of Burma generally, but since the riots by Buddhist monks of 2007, that country has rather faded somewhat from the public consciousness.The appalling fate of the little-known-about Rohingya people, especially those fleeing by boat as refugees that are the subject of this resolution, has renewed our attention on the despotic regime in Burma, a country so rich in human potential otherwise. The brutality of the military junta stands in stark contrast to the action of Thailand, which has only partially, in my view, discharged its responsibility for the Rohingya refugees as it unfortunately alleges that most of them are purely economic refugees which I believe to be highly unlikely, and tried sending them back. Thailand must take more seriously its growing role as a force for stability and humanity in the region.In contrast, we can expect very little from the brutal Burmese military leaders, impervious as they have been to our many pleas for years.

173, 11.2. Situation of Burmese refugees in Thailand,"  Catherine Stihler,  author. − Madam President, the treatment and discrimination of the Rohingya people appals us all.

The shocking reports that a thousand Rohingya boat people over a 12-day period, who, instead of being brought to safety by the Thai authorities who discovered them, were instead towed into international waters without navigational equipment, food and water and left to fend for themselves, sickens anyone with an iota of human decency.Only yesterday, an article in The Guardian highlighted other incidents.

174, 11.2. Situation of Burmese refugees in Thailand,"  Raül Romeva i Rueda,  author. − (ES) Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit the people of Burma and the border between Thailand and Burma. There I saw with my own eyes the injustice with which we treat some parts of the world in political and media terms.All too often, we are only moved by headline news. What we have seen in Burma, which is now no longer on the front pages, is a drama that is not so different from what has mobilised us in many other cases.We have very clear examples of persecution, torture, illegal detention, rape and other atrocities committed by the Burmese military junta. One of the most shameful recent actions has been the adoption of a so-called constitution that violates the most basic democratic principles and guarantees almost complete impunity for all the acts I have just mentioned.It is quite understandable that people flee from this situation, as the Karen population has been doing for several years and, as we are today reporting in the resolution, the Rohingya people has also done, being intercepted in Thailand.In this respect, I noted during my visit that both Thailand and the international community have assumed a disturbing attitude of submission to the junta. For example, many lawyers associations, opposition parties, refugees and political prisoners have alerted us to the terrible consequences that would befall the Burmese people if the international community and, in particular, the European Union were to support and endorse the sham elections that have been called by the SPDC for 2010. They warn us that this would give carte blanche to the junta to continue committing a wide range of crimes with impunity.The political and ethnic groups that oppose the junta are very well organised and have drawn up an alternative constitution that is much more in line with the principles that we say we defend in the European Union. Therefore, for us to abandon them to their fate would be a mistake and would make us accomplices, whether active or passive, to the Burmese dictatorship.

They live in one of the biggest political regimes in the world, from which they try to escape – to the USA, Australia, Canada and to European countries and their neighbours. After adopting resolutions calling for the release of thousands of political prisoners, including many opposition leaders and with a Nobel Prize laureate foremost among them, and after protests from international organisations against the conscription of children in Burma, who are then forced to work and are denied proper care, today we are discussing the problem of human rights violations.During their flight from this Burmese hell, thousands of people – members of the Muslim minority – have been captured in their boats in Thai territorial waters, towed into international waters and left without navigational equipment or food supplies, and some have been imprisoned.The Muslim ethnic minority is also being persecuted by the ruling military regime in Burma. This includes incidents of denial of citizens’ rights, imprisonment, limited access to education, barriers to marriage, restrictions on free movement, and the destruction of mosques, churches and other places of worship. Although we should appreciate the permission granted by the Thai authorities for the temporary stay of refugees there, and also the declaration of the Prime Minister of Thailand in which he has announced an investigation, recent events are nevertheless an obvious example of the violation of human rights by the Thais.Of course we endorse the resolution which, however, does not alter the human tragedies in the region, where the background to the conflicts is not only the inhumane military regime and religious conflicts, but also the interests of various forces.

International agencies are reporting cases of the inhumane treatment of Burmese refugees and of their brutal deportation, which is synonymous with sentencing them to certain death.

Situation of Burmese refugees in Thailand,"  Mariann Fischer Boel,  Member of the Commission. − Madam President, the European Commission, as a matter of priority, is following the situation in Myanmar and Thailand, including the recent incidents where refugees from Bangladesh and Myanmar were stranded in Thailand.Thailand hosts approximately 140 000 refugees in nine camps along the border. More than one million Myanmar citizens constitute an important part of the workforce in Thailand in the agricultural sector, in textiles and in the tourism sector. The Rohingya boat people trapped in Thailand are part of the multi-faceted, forced or voluntary emigration from Myanmar. Moreover, Thailand has other refugee issues to settle as well, such as the Hmong people from Laos.The complexity of these issues requires a comprehensive political, humanitarian, economic and social solution. The Commission is conducting an intensive debate with the international community and the Thai Government, in a search for possible solutions. Recent political uncertainties in Thailand interrupted the dialogue with the Government on this issue, but that is temporary. Thus, the Commission expects that the EU’s initiative vis-à-vis the Government will result in a constructive approach.On 29 January 2009, the EU Troika, at ambassador level in Bangkok, expressed its concerns to the Thai authorities. It welcomed the Thai Government’s intention to investigate the incidents fully, and to share its findings, and urged the Thai Government to treat boat people arriving in Thai waters according to international humanitarian and human rights standards.The Commission welcomes the Government’s intention to allow the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees access to the boat people.The Commission encourages the Thai Government to seek regional cooperation, involving also the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, as the Rohingya issue and the other displacement issues mentioned earlier need a comprehensive response.In conclusion, a sustainable solution cannot be the result of short-term security considerations, but must take into account long-term humanitarian, political and socio-economic concerns.Despite the fact that Thailand is not party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, the Royal Thai Government has, in the past, displayed a measure of humanitarian concern.

And the name of one of the murderers is Cesare Battisti.First of all, I would like to echo the regret expressed by President Napolitano of Italy at the decision made by Mr Lula, the Brazilian president, to grant political refugee status to the Italian terrorist Cesare Battisti, who was sentenced by the courts to life imprisonment for committing those four murders, during the ‘Years of Lead’.Let me remind you that Battisti was found guilty not only by the Italian judiciary, but also by the French judiciary and by the European Court of Human Rights. This is an inexplicable and extremely serious act, which cannot and must not go unnoticed by the European institutions. We have a duty to the relatives of Battisti’s victims, but most importantly, we are also bound because the European Union has, for many years, determined an anti-terrorism strategy to guarantee citizens’ safety and to safeguard democratic institutions. To stand by and watch would thus be to thwart the efforts made over the years to fight side by side against an ever-present threat.The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats also hopes that Brazil will reconsider and think hard about what is a very delicate, but utterly rightful and legitimate request. Brazil is a great democratic country and has always enjoyed an excellent relationship with Europe and with Italy, which is precisely why we have been taken by surprise by this door slammed in our face.

I wonder whether the same thing would have happened if it had been perhaps a German terrorist from the Red Army Faction? Europe is, however, saying to Brazil that to fail to extradite a common criminal and communist like Battisti, who today even in prison dares to mock his victims, would be to downgrade itself to a country of refuge for the worst criminals and terrorists.Such behaviour would call into question all partnership agreements and, I believe, participation in the G8. We must emphasise quite clearly: it is not acceptable to make agreements with terrorists. Terrorists, sentenced under lawful proceedings – because our country has a great legal system, where no one is tortured and proceedings are legitimate – must then serve their sentence to the very last day.
