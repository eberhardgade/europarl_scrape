2, 2. Statement by the President,"  President.   – Ladies and gentlemen, before we begin the session, I would like to say a few words. As you know, 10 days ago, the President of Poland, Lech Kaczyński, signed the Treaty of Lisbon. I am certain we are a step closer to completion of the ratification process. I am also sure that ratification will soon be completed, too, by the Czech Republic.I would like to inform you that this week, on Tuesday at 15.00, our first Question Hour with the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, will take place. This debate represents a significant institutional change. It will make the European Parliament’s work with the Commission significantly better. I have worked on this matter with the Chairs of the political groups and President Barroso, and am pleased that the new procedure will become a permanent feature of plenary sessions in Strasbourg. I am sure that it will make our debates more lively and open up our discussions even further.Ladies and gentlemen, on 10 October, we observed the International Day for the Abolition of the Death Penalty. Since 2007, this date has also been European Day against the Death Penalty, when we demonstrate our determination and commitment against this inhumane practice. We also present our position in support of a worldwide moratorium in accordance with the declaration of Parliament made in a resolution in 2007, and the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly.In a press release on 9 October, I stressed, in my own name and on behalf of the European Parliament, our commitment to creating a Europe without capital punishment, and also for its abolition everywhere in the world. This is our common obligation. Unfortunately, there is still one country in Europe where the death penalty is pronounced and carried out. That country is Belarus. We condemn the carrying out of executions in Iran, and we express particular fears for Iranians who have been sentenced to death following the demonstrations which accompanied the presidential election in June. Above all, we oppose the handing down of death sentences to juveniles, and would like to point out that this year marks the 20th anniversary of adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which explicitly forbids the execution of minors.We must continue to oppose capital punishment resolutely, and to speak out about instances of its use everywhere in the world. We are disturbed by recent events in China, where 12 people have been sentenced to death following the ethnic disturbances and violence in Urumchi in Xinjiang Province. Despite the serious crimes which were committed during the disturbances in June, we call upon the Chinese authorities to maintain the standards of honest trial proceedings. We are also disturbed by cases of the pronouncement and carrying out of the death penalty in the United States, especially in the State of Ohio, where, after several unsuccessful attempts, executions by lethal injection have been postponed.I would like to reiterate our appeal to every country still applying the death penalty to abolish it from its criminal code or establish, pending its abolition, a moratorium on the pronouncement and carrying out of death sentences.(Applause) ",President.,7,530,not_available,"['gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla']","['  President.   – Ladies and gentlemen, before we begin the session, I would like to say a few words.

This vote without debate does not permit speeches and thus does not permit the Member concerned to express himself before his peers, before his fellow Members.

For these states, the way out of the economic crisis is closely linked to a full transition to the euro. Although, since 2005, all the Baltic currencies have been directly pegged to the euro, because of the official Maastricht criteria they still cannot fully join the euro area. It is therefore the case that the Baltic States are suffering from the European Central Bank’s low interest rate policy, which brought the loans and property bubbles to a head, but they are prevented from enjoying the true fruits of currency stability. I call upon you to take a political decision so that the euro can be introduced in the Baltic States on an exceptional basis. The small economies of these states are not a threat to the euro area.

West Wales and the Valleys receives the highest level of support under the current Structural Funds, and rightly so.Many regard the UK as a wealthy place to live. Very few people know the reality of the scale of poverty and unemployment in Wales. The Valleys have all but been destroyed by the closure of big industries which, at one point, were the backbone of solid hardworking communities. Today, the mines are closed. The factories that grew up in their place are outsourcing work overseas. The communities that thrived on this employment have not just lost their jobs but also their sense of purpose and belonging.With more and more countries queuing up to join the EU, I am worried that Wales will see much-needed support go to newer member countries. I urge the Commission and the Council to ensure that Wales receives adequate funding, through a strong transitional settlement, when the current round of Structural Funds ceases in 2013.

Together, they form an unpleasant cocktail of old Soviet design and American engineering. From a legal point of view, the whole issue is problematic, as environmental impact assessments are not carried out in compliance with European legislation in either country. The parties to the proceedings have no possibility of obtaining judicial review of the final decision.

We cannot allow our market, all that we have accomplished in this area in Europe, to be dominated by one firm. We must develop good legal instruments, which will protect the interests of our authors and publishers, and the European Union must do this together with others, especially with the United States, but also with other countries in today’s globalised world.', 'It is a question of our European literature, our culture, and our identity. We must develop these things, and act together to protect them. They are our European authors and our European publishers.

The election of the president by the new parliament, scheduled for 23 October, was postponed due to a lack of competition. Once again, by resorting to subversive tactics through not put forwarding a candidate, the Communist Party is attempting to sabotage the path to democracy.It is our duty to monitor the entire process closely to ensure that the constitutional provisions are applied and that the Republic of Moldova passes the democratic test of elections.The strengthening of democracy in this country must be one of the priorities of the European Union in its neighbourhood policy.

Local radio stations in Ireland are required to ensure that 20% of their news content is national and international. This service has largely been supplied by INN in recent years.On foot of INN’s demise, the Newstalk station owned by Communicorp – which is also a major shareholder in INN – has been awarded the contract to provide a replacement service for the next six months. UTV, whose withdrawal from INN precipitated the service’s demise, has also been centrally involved in the efforts to source a replacement service. The National Union of Journalists has raised important questions over the appropriateness of the involvement of these two bodies in this process, in the context of diversity of media ownership in Ireland. These questions must be fully explored.

57, 17. Evaluation mechanism to monitor the application of the Schengen acquis - Establishment of an evaluation mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis (debate) ,"  Carlos Coelho,  rapporteur. – (PT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favour of a mechanism for evaluating Schengen that will improve the system currently in place and make it more efficient, so as to ensure that the Schengen acquis can be applied more transparently and coherently.Nevertheless, I am disappointed with the proposals put forward by the European Commission. In essence, these proposals maintain the rules relating to the first part of the mandate without making any changes and, with regard to the second part of the mandate, or the evaluation of how the Schengen acquis is being implemented by the Member States that are already part of the Schengen area, they merely incorporate the recent improvements to the current evaluation mechanism.Indeed, the only new thing, which I applaud, is the possibility of carrying out unannounced visits. As far as the evaluation process is concerned, these proposals transfer the role currently played by the Council wholly into the hands of the Commission, allowing very limited forms of cooperation with the Member States, and removing the European Parliament from the entire process, without demonstrating what is being gained by these steps.I am also concerned that we are moving towards the total separation of the evaluation mechanisms for each part of the mandate, which could jeopardise the efficiency and consistency of the system. Countries that wish to join Schengen should not be subject to different rules and systems of evaluation to those that are already in it.There are also data protection problems. I shall give just three examples: firstly, the item about the security of consular facilities is incomplete, as the facilities of external companies, when outsourcing is involved, are not covered. Secondly, the security requirements proposed for the Schengen Information System (SIS) should also be included in the item about visas. Thirdly, Article 7 of the regulation should include not only the risk analysis but also the audits and reports on the security inspections carried out by the Member States in accordance with the rules introduced by the statutory instruments of the SIS and the Visa Information System (VIS).Besides the problems I have mentioned here, and the improvements that could be made, there is a fundamental problem in that the role given to the European Parliament is an irrelevant one. According to our Legal Service, the Commission’s choice of legal basis is legitimate. However, it would also be possible to apply the codecision procedure for the draft regulation. Political will is the only deciding factor between the two possibilities. After all, if the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force, which is to be expected in the short term, these proposals will have to be made into a single proposal and resubmitted, since the pillar structure will be eliminated.We should not forget that we are discussing the security of the area of freedom, security and justice, which should involve all Member States and all the European institutions. Hence, codecision is the right procedure to choose. The European Parliament’s role should not be merely accessory, but should rather reflect the influence that it wields when it comes to adopting basic legislative instruments.I would like to conclude by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for supporting this position for the European Parliament and I invite Vice-President Barrot, who has always shown respect for this Parliament, to resubmit these proposals, introducing not only improvements in terms of the content, but also establishing a proper role for the European Parliament as regards the procedure itself.

58, 17. Evaluation mechanism to monitor the application of the Schengen acquis - Establishment of an evaluation mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis (debate) ,"  Jacques Barrot,  Vice-President of the Commission. – (FR) Mr President, I will try to respond to the concerns expressed by Mr Coelho in his report.The evaluation mechanism is a key measure when it comes to preserving the integrity of the Schengen area and to maintaining mutual confidence between the Member States. That is why the Commission is proposing that the experts from the Member States be fully involved in planning the visits, the in situ visits, and in drafting the evaluation and follow-up reports.The Commission is, of course, convinced that Parliament should be involved in the Schengen evaluation, which is not the case at present. The citizens must have access to the results of these evaluations. That is why the Commission has offered to submit annual reports to Parliament indicating the conclusions reached following each evaluation and the progress of the corrective measures.So that is the first response. It is true that Mr Coelho raised the issue of codecision for Parliament. The treaties currently in force do not permit this. However, although there is no codecision as yet, the proposals do communitise the current mechanism. Through these proposals, the mechanism can be made more effective with regard to planning, the in situ visits and the follow-up given to the evaluations.Moreover, the role of the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, will be enhanced. However, Mr Coelho, this enhanced role is being challenged strongly by the Council. Therefore, under the treaties in force, two parallel proposals were required, since the Schengen acquis covers both the first and the third pillars.The Commission considered that Article 66 of the EC Treaty, which provides for consultation of the European Parliament, was the correct legal basis for the proposal of the first pillar. This legal basis was chosen as the correct one for the current Schengen evaluation mechanism when the Schengen acquis was integrated into the European Union framework by the ‘breakdown’ decision taken in 1999.Articles 30 and 31 of the treaty were the ones chosen as a legal basis for the proposal of the third pillar. That is why we had to refer to two different articles for the evaluation of the first pillar and for that of the third pillar.The Commission, on the basis of the treaties in force and of the legal debates that derive from them, must stand by its proposals. It must be said, Mr Coelho, that, given the difficult negotiations at the Council regarding the enhanced role of the Commission, it is conceivable that they will not be concluded in the short term. We can hope, above all today, that this Treaty of Lisbon will be ratified, and then the matter will be reopened and the Commission will decide, when the time comes, what it considers to be the most appropriate legal basis for the proposed mechanism by involving the European Parliament as fully as possible.Obviously, when that time comes, the Commission will be able to submit amended or new proposals depending on the situation. As you know, I myself am generally very much in favour of this provision, which will enable your Parliament to act as a colegislator in most of the issues relating to justice, freedom and security. Clearly, I can only be in favour of a much more active role for Parliament. However, as things stand, I do not think that we could have done anything other than to propose this amendment on the current legal bases. Nevertheless, as I told you, the discussions at the Council are not easy; this is not because we did not want to involve the Member States, but because the Commission, in its role as guardian of the treaties, feels that it, too, is responsible for managing this entire evaluation mechanism, with the involvement of the Member States and, of course, Parliament.

Evaluation mechanism to monitor the application of the Schengen acquis - Establishment of an evaluation mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis (debate) ,"  Simon Busuttil,  on behalf of the PPE Group. – (MT) The creation of the Schengen zone was undoubtedly a huge step forward for several European Union countries. It brought along with it the concept of full liberty of movement for our citizens in a more realistic manner, and it could even be said that when a citizen travels within the Schengen area, he or she might almost feel as though they are travelling within their own country. However we are all aware that for an ambitious project such as this to succeed as it did, a substantial amount of hard work was put into it, and considerable sacrifice was made. Above all, when we chose to open our doors to each other, we had to place our trust in each other on an issue as delicate as this one, that is, the protection of our external borders. When it comes to external borders, trust is placed in a country and trust is gained in return.Therefore, when it comes to these reports, I agree with my colleague Carlos Coelho, in that they are meant to enhance the evaluation mechanism within the Schengen Area project; a project which is of great importance, and which is built upon mutual trust. Yet we also maintain that this evaluation needs to be carried out in an efficient and transparent manner. Moreover, it must involve Parliament, which must be allowed to exercise its full powers, especially now that we are, or potentially are, a few weeks away from the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty.

Evaluation mechanism to monitor the application of the Schengen acquis - Establishment of an evaluation mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis (debate) ,"  Ioan Enciu,  on behalf of the S&D Group. – (RO) The creation of an evaluation and monitoring mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis is an important measure which will put into practice the decisions concerning the area of freedom, security and justice, especially the provisions of the Hague Programme. The draft proposals submitted for debate today are a variation of an evaluation mechanism. They include provisions specific to the targeted area, along with an adequate control methodology.However, a closer analysis highlights that certain principles of interinstitutional cooperation are being ignored, both at European Union level and between EU Member States. From this point of view, the proposal submitted includes provisions restricting cooperation between Member States with regard to evaluating the results from the application of the Schengen Agreement. At the same time, it increases unacceptably the role of the Commission in this process, while the European Parliament is kept outside the entire evaluation mechanism.Furthermore, the wording of some articles in the regulation leaves scope for different interpretations of the relationship between the Commission, Parliament and Council with regard to their access to information about the application of the Schengen acquis.Therefore, Article 14, aimed at sensitive information, emphasises that ‘the reports drawn up following on-site visits shall be classified as restricted. The Commission, after consulting the Member State concerned, shall decide which part of the report can be made public.’I also wish to mention in connection with these provisions that Article 16, which refers to the report submitted to the European Parliament and Council, does not imply that the annual report on the evaluations carried out will contain restricted information as well. We could therefore deduce that it is up to the Commission to assess which information will be included in the annual report and which not. This fact assigns the Commission functions which, in my view, are not justified.The Treaty of Lisbon will soon come into force and from then on, codecision will become the normal legislative procedure, which also covers the area of freedom, security and justice. The legislative proposals which we are debating at the moment contain provisions which conflict with the principles included in the Treaty. Consequently, these drafts, if they are approved now, will need to be reviewed at the time when the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force.Fellow Members, freedom, security and justice are areas of paramount importance to Europe’s citizens whose interests are represented directly by the European legislative.

61, 17. Evaluation mechanism to monitor the application of the Schengen acquis - Establishment of an evaluation mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis (debate) ,"  Sarah Ludford,  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, our colleague, Mr Coelho, has yet again justified his middle name: Carlos ‘Schengen’ Coelho. He is our resident expert on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and we are very grateful for his work and his expertise. He has done very good forensic reports on these proposals and they highlight what an awful muddle the European Union is in regarding monitoring and evaluation.It certainly makes no sense to me that fitness to join the Schengen zone should lie exclusively in the hands of the Member States in any case, irrespective of any arcane split between pre- and post-Schengen accession. We are told in the Commission proposal for the regulation that ‘as evaluation before putting into effect is fundamental for Member States in order to gain mutual trust, it seems reasonable for this to remain the responsibility of Member States’. But we do not leave it to Member States to evaluate the Balkan countries, for which this evening the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs will vote on their fitness for visa waiver, for visa-free travel – it is the Commission which does the assessment and evaluation, so there is no consistency at all in saying that it should be in the hands of the Member States to judge other states.To be honest, I do not grasp this peculiar split between evaluation of ‘putting into effect’ measures necessary to join Schengen which, according to the Commission, has to remain intergovernmental, and checking the ‘implementation’ of the Schengen acquis. Certainly, it appears that the Member States do not do a very good job because we learn from the proposal for a decision that ‘in recent years, Member States have not seen the need to carry out evaluations on the spot concerning judicial cooperation in criminal matters and drugs. Data protection has also not always been subject to on-site evaluations.’ I think there are many people not only in this House but beyond who would think that issues to do with criminal cooperation, drugs, tackling drug smuggling and protection of privacy are rather important matters to have on-the-spot inspections about. So I entirely support the conclusions of Carlos Coelho that we need to bring all this together, to have a consolidation of the procedures by which this evaluation is done, to consolidate the task between the first and the third pillar – and I hope that soon the phrase ‘third pillar’ will be consigned to history and I never have to say it again – to have one simple, effective, efficient and transparent evaluation and to ensure that the transparency includes accountability to the European Parliament.It is most strange that at this juncture, on the eve of what I am now convinced will be the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty – and I did my bit in the UK House of Lords last year, by the way – the Commission should put forward this extremely muddled and senseless set of proposals. I support the rejection and I request the Commission to come back with a better proposal that takes account of the Lisbon Treaty, takes account of codecision, takes account of simplicity and effectiveness in monitoring and is consistent with the Commission’s and Parliament’s responsibilities in other areas.It begs the whole question of the way peer review is done in this European Union of the 27 Member States. As I say, that bears looking at, including in the human rights area, because we do not seem to have any clear principles and structures and simply adopt different things in different areas. Much as I love the Member States, I am afraid they often adopt a practice of ‘I’ll scratch your back and you scratch mine’, which means they do not criticise each other, so actually they are not good people to evaluate each other. The Commission, when it works at its best, is the one to do it.As I have a few seconds left, I would like to challenge Mr Bradbourn from the ECR Group on an issue of free movement. He called for a global ban on so-called ‘naked body scanners’. It would have helped if he had been at the vote last year when his colleagues opposed a ban on the use of these body scanners without a fundamental review of human rights. His colleagues voted against that ban. Mr Bradbourn was not even present at the vote, so it is a bit rich for him to go on about it now.

But we do not leave it to Member States to evaluate the Balkan countries, for which this evening the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs will vote on their fitness for visa waiver, for visa-free travel – it is the Commission which does the assessment and evaluation, so there is no consistency at all in saying that it should be in the hands of the Member States to judge other states.', 'To be honest, I do not grasp this peculiar split between evaluation of ‘putting into effect’ measures necessary to join Schengen which, according to the Commission, has to remain intergovernmental, and checking the ‘implementation’ of the Schengen acquis. Certainly, it appears that the Member States do not do a very good job because we learn from the proposal for a decision that ‘in recent years, Member States have not seen the need to carry out evaluations on the spot concerning judicial cooperation in criminal matters and drugs. Data protection has also not always been subject to on-site evaluations.’ I think there are many people not only in this House but beyond who would think that issues to do with criminal cooperation, drugs, tackling drug smuggling and protection of privacy are rather important matters to have on-the-spot inspections about. So I entirely support the conclusions of Carlos Coelho that we need to bring all this together, to have a consolidation of the procedures by which this evaluation is done, to consolidate the task between the first and the third pillar – and I hope that soon the phrase ‘third pillar’ will be consigned to history and I never have to say it again – to have one simple, effective, efficient and transparent evaluation and to ensure that the transparency includes accountability to the European Parliament.', 'It is most strange that at this juncture, on the eve of what I am now convinced will be the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty – and I did my bit in the UK House of Lords last year, by the way – the Commission should put forward this extremely muddled and senseless set of proposals. I support the rejection and I request the Commission to come back with a better proposal that takes account of the Lisbon Treaty, takes account of codecision, takes account of simplicity and effectiveness in monitoring and is consistent with the Commission’s and Parliament’s responsibilities in other areas.', 'It begs the whole question of the way peer review is done in this European Union of the 27 Member States. As I say, that bears looking at, including in the human rights area, because we do not seem to have any clear principles and structures and simply adopt different things in different areas. Much as I love the Member States, I am afraid they often adopt a practice of ‘I’ll scratch your back and you scratch mine’, which means they do not criticise each other, so actually they are not good people to evaluate each other. The Commission, when it works at its best, is the one to do it.', 'As I have a few seconds left, I would like to challenge Mr Bradbourn from the ECR Group on an issue of free movement. He called for a global ban on so-called ‘naked body scanners’. It would have helped if he had been at the vote last year when his colleagues opposed a ban on the use of these body scanners without a fundamental review of human rights. His colleagues voted against that ban. Mr Bradbourn was not even present at the vote, so it is a bit rich for him to go on about it now. ']"

It is, therefore, high time that we improved the evaluation procedures and responded to concerns about the Schengen area.It is a shame that the Commission, on approaching this anniversary, has failed to do enough work or make much progress in creating a more effective and comprehensive evaluation mechanism which would be able to respond not only to the concerns raised in the early years of the Schengen area, such as efficiency and cohesion among Member States and a certain equivalence of procedures, but also concerns about transparency, control by citizens (democratic control) and, finally, concerns about respect for human rights, which are extremely dear to this House. There are well-founded concerns that greater efficiency has been achieved at the cost of citizens’ rights, and it is high time that we bridged this gap.I would also like to talk briefly about codecision.

However, it introduces a change that is obviously significant, as the document that is before us would mean transferring the functions currently carried out by the Council to the Commission.This transfer of powers means de facto that Parliament and the Member States themselves are sidelined in the evaluation process, despite the fact that they are the ones with power over the security of their external borders.Parliament, which represents European citizens, plays an essential, leading role in security matters.

I hope you are proud of yourself.', 'You would be aware of the 1951 Convention on Refugees that says that a refugee should claim asylum in the first safe country – but you disregard that. You disregard international law and you purport to be a responsible legal personality, as Lisbon would make you. Come on, pull the other one: this place is a joke! The people of the United Kingdom want to control its own borders; it has had enough of being ruled by you. I leave you with this warning: the British people are a just, tolerant and trusting people, but when you push us too far, we fight back. And when we fight back, we win. ']"

This certainly has more to do with the lack of political will to monitor external borders effectively on the part of the governments of most Member States and the EU itself than it does with the lack of efficient evaluation mechanisms.We all know that there are some Member States who are unable or unwilling to protect their EU external borders against illegal immigration. We all know that there are some governments who are undermining the whole Schengen system through the mass regularisation of illegal aliens. I would cite the examples of the Zapatero Government in Spain and also the governments of Italy, the Netherlands and, last but not least, Belgium. The Belgian Government is currently preparing to regularise new illegal immigrants on a massive scale and is thereby putting the whole system at risk, since the illegal immigrants thus regularised are able to settle wherever they wish in the European Union.

With the further expansion of the EU, there is a growing risk of terrorism and organised crime and higher levels of security must therefore be a priority. It is reprehensible that the changeover to the new database is again being delayed. The system contains data on missing persons, stolen goods and judicial proceedings. The current system has been in operation since 1995 and was developed for up to 18 countries. I applaud the flexibility of the Commission, which has made the Schengen expansion possible, despite the delays with SIS II. The incorporation of the nine new Member States was possible only under exceptional conditions, of course.The second version of the system is delayed at least until 2011. It is supposed to bring improvements in administration, flexibility, security and data storage capacities, as well as providing other new functionalities. It will enable other states to join, including a link to Great Britain and Ireland. The FRONTEX agency must also have all the powers it needs for combating illegal immigration effectively. Nevertheless, I have reservations over the communitarisation of the Schengen Working Group, because I am concerned that it will lead to Member States abandoning their responsibility to provide controls. On the other hand, I would like to draw your attention to the experience of Czech citizens, as I know of cases where German and Austrian police officers have harassed Czech drivers without reason.I regret that President Klaus is nonsensically delaying ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, but it is clear that soon after that happens, the Commission will have to submit the legislation again, this time under the codecision procedure of the European Parliament.

Most of us agree that Schengen has been a great success, and that for the people of the new countries, the new Member States of the European Union, this means the significant success of integration. However, at the same time, Schengen is an enormous obligation, and it is the new countries which have taken it on – the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. Responsibility for the eastern land border of the European Union rests on the new Member States, and they are meeting this obligation extremely well.However, I would like to talk about something which has not been mentioned in this Chamber. What is for us a matter of admiration and pride – I mean Schengen and freedom of movement – is a nightmare and a source of huge problems for all those who are covered by the visa policy and the need to obtain what are called ‘Schengen visas’. I am talking about the residents of Ukraine, Moldova and other countries to the east, who want to come to the European Union. Schengen visas have been introduced, but they cost a great deal. For these visas, people in those countries have to pay roughly as much as they earn per month. They are subjected to a humiliating procedure for obtaining these visas, and they have to stand in gigantic queues. This, too, is Schengen. For them, Schengen means humiliation, a wall and a problem.In order to establish a system to evaluate the function of Schengen policy, I would like at least to mention matters related to visa policy. I would like to evaluate this. Perhaps there was some kind of justification for this, but we do not know how long this policy will be in force, and I would like to evaluate how we introduced such instruments, which separate us from many people who quite naturally want to come to our area, to the Schengen area.

This degree of freedom of movement obviously depends on broad-based trust between the states concerned.It is absolutely necessary for the free movement of passenger traffic to be sustainably regulated by effective flanking measures. Of central importance in this context is efficient supervision and control of the external borders, which – as we know – are to be carried out to a uniform standard through the Schengen Information System and by introducing harmonised entry requirements for third country nationals. However, we are still miles away from that. Compliance with accompanying mechanisms is therefore an essential factor for the security of EU citizens.My country, Austria, is particularly affected, due to its geographical proximity to the eastern European states. You only need think in this context of the latest incidents during the confiscation of a refrigerated lorry in Austria, which was found to contain 64 illegal Kurdish immigrants being smuggled from Turkey, via Hungary and Austria, to Germany. This case shows how important it is to be able to rely on proper and effective control of external borders and how rare that is the case.In internal affairs, we also have to battle with increasing crime in numerous regions of Europe which, increasingly often, stems from organised, cross-border gangs. This being so, I believe that we should carefully consider temporarily re-introducing controls at internal borders.

The security of the Schengen Area depends on how stringently and effectively the controls are imposed by each Member State at their external borders. Given that a two-fold evaluation mechanism is involved in this case, it must be implemented, as we are talking about evaluating and verifying the application of the Schengen Community acquis to ensure that it is implemented in a transparent, effective and consistent manner.While we should welcome the Commission’s proposal for both a decision and regulation, as we feel that this will raise the level of mutual trust between Member States which are part of an area free of any internal borders and provide high uniform standards in the specific application of the Schengen acquis, we believe, however, that it ought to be reviewed taking into account and following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.I welcome the fact that in the Commission’s proposal, Member States are working with the Commission as part of the coordination group to enable the Commission to implement this evaluation mechanism.

This is a major project concerning exceptionally important areas of the lives of EU citizens, such as justice, freedom and security. For instance, two elements of the programme, the freedom and security of EU citizens, clearly should be included in the evaluation of the Schengen project.We must, therefore, ask ourselves what the European Union was set up for and why it is so important for us that this great project succeed. After all, it was not created for the politicians or for international organisations, but for particular states. It was, in fact, set up for the good of its citizens. Therefore, the good of the citizens, their freedom and liberty, but also the highest possible standards of security which should be guaranteed to them, are one of the main elements of the work which the EU institutions should undertake.It is, therefore, not good that we are discussing the Schengen area on its own without combining this discussion with an evaluation of the EU’s migration programme, visa programme and the programme for cooperation with neighbouring countries.

Evaluation mechanism to monitor the application of the Schengen acquis - Establishment of an evaluation mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis (debate) ,"  Alan Kelly  (S&D).   – Madam President, it is with great regret that I am addressing the House as a Member from a country that has not yet opted into the Schengen Agreement. It is something I would support entry into. It is my hope that the Schengen Evaluation Working Group will finally demonstrate to the Irish State, and indeed our neighbours across the way in Britain, the undoubted benefits of Schengen.Freedom of movement is a basic right and a pillar of EU citizenship for which we are all striving. Being able to reduce borders and allow the freedom and benefits of travel to EU citizens has been quite remarkable, especially considering European history. The fact that this was done while increasing the ability of our authorities to tackle crime associated with crossing borders has been a major historic achievement and one of the great successes of the EU to date. It was the Schengen Agreement that prompted Ireland to build a full data system of criminal information that will hopefully be linked up to a European system in the coming years.

It is true that we have Schengen – I also note that the vast majority of MEPs celebrated this Schengen success, which makes it possible to have freedom of movement and, at the same time, security.It is true that the Schengen evaluation was on an intergovernmental basis to begin with, and that the Commission was there only in an observer capacity. However, it is true that the Commission, as the guardian of the treaties, must be responsible for the evaluation. There is no question, however, that it will have a monopoly over the evaluation – we must be very clear about that. We will, of course, involve the Member States, and the experts from the Member States will be involved in planning the timetable of the visits, in performing the in situ visits, and in drafting the evaluation report.It is quite clear that the misgivings that we sense within the Member States are also due to a misunderstanding. Since we want mutual confidence between the Member States, there is no question of our not involving them closely in the evaluation of the measures taken to apply Schengen and the Schengen acquis.I now come to Parliament. There is a misunderstanding here too. Our aim is not to exclude Parliament, as I heard someone say. Our aim, as things stand, is simply to see how Parliament’s involvement can already be increased, with regular reports. However, this does not, in any way, preclude the possibility of our giving Parliament a greater role in this communitised mechanism, once the Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified. I am somewhat insistent because we know that the European general interest can prevail when this method is used, even if, at times, a Member State may drag its heels a little when it comes to defending this European general interest.Thus, there are some misunderstandings that I would like to try to clear up.Furthermore, I would also like to say that the proposals bring a certain added value when compared with the current mechanism. The evaluations will be far more frequent and will be clearer. Visits will be planned in situ, on the basis of risk assessments; there will be unannounced visits and a high level of expertise throughout the evaluation exercise, and the number of experts taking part will make the visits effective.The assessment of the follow-up to the recommendations made at the end of the in situ evaluations will be improved.Those are my thoughts, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. I fully understand your impatience to see Parliament’s involvement increased when the Treaty of Lisbon is ratified.

We are also aware of this, and we realise that it would be difficult for things to be any other way when dealing with this matter. For this reason, we also hoped that the Commission would see Parliament as a partner with powers of codecision, because in terms of their approach to Europe, the Commission and Parliament alike are positively identified with the idea that decision making cannot continue to be purely intergovernmental.Thirdly, I would like to underline two things that I believe have come out of this debate.

These reports, in fact, consist of an agreement which provides for a short stay visa waiver between the European Union and its citizens and the citizens of six different countries – The Republic of Mauritius, The Republic of Seychelles, Barbados, The Federation of St Kitts and Nevis, the Bahamas as well as Antigua and Barbuda.This waiver applies to European Union citizens who travel to these countries and vice-versa, that is, when citizens from these countries travel to the European Union. It is valid for a maximum stay of three months within a six month period. This waiver covers all categories of persons, meaning ordinary citizens as well as diplomats travelling for various reasons. This applies particularly to the numerous tourists who are European Union citizens and who go on holiday to these six countries, and thus we will be greatly facilitating things for them.This agreement however, specifically excludes those who travel for work and remuneration purposes.

These reports, in fact, consist of an agreement which provides for a short stay visa waiver between the European Union and its citizens and the citizens of six different countries – The Republic of Mauritius, The Republic of Seychelles, Barbados, The Federation of St Kitts and Nevis, the Bahamas as well as Antigua and Barbuda.', 'This waiver applies to European Union citizens who travel to these countries and vice-versa, that is, when citizens from these countries travel to the European Union. It is valid for a maximum stay of three months within a six month period. This waiver covers all categories of persons, meaning ordinary citizens as well as diplomats travelling for various reasons. This applies particularly to the numerous tourists who are European Union citizens and who go on holiday to these six countries, and thus we will be greatly facilitating things for them.', ""This agreement however, specifically excludes those who travel for work and remuneration purposes.

This means that those exempted from the visa requirement are businessmen and women, sportspeople and artists – at least when it comes to performing a one-off activity – journalists and trainees, among others.Let us not be fussy and let us welcome this progress, since we know all the administrative formalities that are carried out in our embassies in order to issue visas to citizens of countries of the South.I am sure, ladies and gentlemen – at least those who are left – that you have all heard about these cases of artists who are prevented from attending a festival or of sportspeople who cannot take part in competitions.

99, 19. Progress of SIS II and VIS (debate) ,"  Jacques Barrot,  Vice-President of the Commission. – (FR) Madam President, I would not wish to try Parliament’s patience, but all the same, I do need to clarify a number of things for the MEPs here present and for Parliament.When, a year and a half ago, I took on the portfolio of commissioner responsible for justice, freedom and security, I found on my desk two large-scale information technology projects aimed at equipping the Member States with modern and effective cooperation tools.Those two projects, SIS II and VIS, formed part of the same contract, signed in 2003, between the Commission and a consortium of information technology companies. Both of these projects are technologically complex. We need to interconnect a central system and national equipment with particularly demanding specifications, and make them interact.I have always tried to keep Parliament informed of these developments. Following the Justice and Home Affairs Councils in February and June 2009, I wrote to Mr Deprez, the chairman of Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to inform him of how the work on SIS II was progressing. I sent you a copy of that correspondence, Mr Coelho, because you are the usual rapporteur for SIS-related issues, and you follow these issues closely.Motivated as I am by this spirit of openness, I should like today, once again, to give you as much information as possible. It is true that, like most major industrial projects, both SIS II and VIS are in danger of going over schedule and over budget. It is true that the situation is unsatisfactory as regards both SIS II and VIS.Despite the involvement of experts from the Commission and the Member States, SIS II continues to come up against various obstacles. VIS, for its part, has entered an important phase. The initial specifications made it difficult to perform the planned tests but it seems that, with the Member States’ agreement, the review of these specifications should enable the tests to be completed successfully next time.I come firstly to SIS II. The Commission is working closely with the Presidency, the Member States and the contractors to implement the guidelines laid down in the conclusions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 4 and 5 June.Firstly, all the parties concerned are actively involved in the technical preparations for a first ‘milestone’ test aimed at ensuring that the current technical solution is built on a solid foundation. With this in mind, the Commission has negotiated the contractual changes required with the consortium in charge of the project. For the first milestone, there is an extra cost of EUR 1 026 000. At the same time, our services have stepped up the governance and monitoring of the project. They have introduced contractual penalties so as to put added pressure on the contractor.On Friday evening, I summoned and met with the CEO of the company in charge of the project so that he could inform me personally of the measures that he was implementing to resolve the technical difficulties.Finally, for precautionary purposes, as was stipulated by the June Council, the Commission has begun the preparatory work with a view to potentially switching to the alternative scheme should the current technical solution fail.In order to take account of this data and of the new timetable, we must obviously translate these circumstances into legislation. That is why, on 29 September, the Commission proposed some amendments to the SIS II migration instruments, amendments on which your Parliament is currently being consulted. This will give us an opportunity to review the issue in detail.As regards VIS, in April 2009, the contractor began a series of tests on the central system in order to assess the progress made. The contractor has not yet succeeded in meeting all of the contractual criteria required to conclude this series of tests, even though its deadline was extended.The Commission has, of course, applied the contractual penalties provided for to punish this delay. It has ordered the contractor to implement all of the appropriate corrective measures.I do not believe, but I may be proved wrong, that there is a design problem. On the other hand, it would seem that the STT is going well. The tests should be concluded on 11 November. However, in parallel to this, the Member States must also adapt their own national systems so that they can use VIS. At least three Member States are encountering major difficulties, and the delays due to these three States are even more significant than those caused by the central system.Thus, we are currently performing a detailed analysis with the Member States in order to set out a new timetable for the launch of VIS. To do this, however, we need to have a clear idea of the outcome of the series of tests on the central system.My meeting on Friday gives me reason to believe that 11 November could be the date when we will know whether the tests under way are successful. In any event, however, both the national systems and the central system must be fully operational before the system is launched. I will, of course, inform Parliament of this new timetable as soon as we have been able to draft it.I shall finish here – please excuse me for my rather lengthy speech, but I really wanted to give a detailed account of the progress of SIS II and VIS. There is real cause for concern; there is no point in hiding it. The technical, budgetary and political risk profiles of both projects justify us all getting involved, given our respective responsibilities. Significant financial resources have been harnessed. The total amount of the Commission’s budget commitments on SIS II stands at just over EUR 80 million, of which just over half, or EUR 44.5 million, have so far been paid. The total amount that the Commission has already committed to VIS so far is in the region of EUR 74.5 million. In terms of budgetary implementation, nearly EUR 43.3 million have actually been spent to date. These figures are in line with those of projects on a similar scale developed in Europe and elsewhere in the world.Madam President, I am anxious to say here that I will definitely inform Parliament of any developments that may have an impact on the budget, or indeed on the launch date for these systems.However, if we succeed with VIS and SIS II, we will have equipped Europe with the most effective system in the world. We therefore have to tackle the obstacles in a calm, clear and practical fashion, and in this respect, I will take the liberty of requesting Parliament’s help as often as I need it in order, once again, to monitor these two issues very closely and to ensure their successful conclusion.

Yet, although we intended the Schengen area to offer complete freedom to our citizens, we do not want to bestow this privilege upon criminals. For this reason, we created the Schengen information system, which was meant to be upgraded to a new generation system known as SIS II in order to help us strengthen our citizens’ freedom whilst holding back criminals from gaining any sort of leeway. Therefore, the fact that this new generation system, SIS II, is well overdue and yet still does not look like it is anywhere near being finished is of concern to us. This is why we are putting these questions to you now as to the reason for this delay and as to whether it would be possible to guarantee a date by which the system will be up and running. However, I would like to make it abundantly clear that our final target is to work together with the European Commission to ensure that the Schengen area is fully operational and that it works in the best interests of our citizens, without giving free reign to those with the wrong intentions.

We appreciate the manner in which he has done that.Like Mr Busuttil, I want to set out an explanation – which is a joint explanation – of our serious concern regarding the significant delays in migration from SIS to SIS II and the development of VIS. I think you will understand why we tabled a joint resolution, because there is a genuine concern here. Mr Coelho and others have been making this concern known for some time and it is worth putting on record that, while these significant delays are obviously highly worrying on their own, the key issues here for Parliament, as you know, are those of transparency and accountability, particularly when we are dealing with sensitive data, and sensitive data in this area. As co-legislator and the EU’s only directly elected institution, Parliament needs to be kept informed about the developments of these systems, as it has requested many times in the past.In our resolution, we do not want to be seen to be making unreasonable demands. We want to be reasonable, and we want to respond to the way in which you have given us the information today. We simply want to be informed of the current state of play, to be given explanations about the reasons for the delay, and to be reassured that these problems will be resolved. It is vital that a project as important as this, which will have an impact on vast numbers of people – both EU and non-EU citizens – is developed transparently.However, in addition to the issues of transparency and accountability, it is also important to point out some of the wider implications. The technical problems we are seeing, and the development of these large-scale databases, do not inspire wider confidence. Many of our Member States – including my own Member State – have had significant difficulties in their own development of major databases, in development of ID databases and so on. Public confidence in these systems is absolutely vital.Therefore, we certainly have to look jointly across the political parties to see how these problems arose, how they can be prevented in the future, at the planning stage rather than the development stage. Lessons have to be learned; we have to have confidence in these systems and, above all, we have to have full and effective oversight. In the end, these systems will only work through technical cooperation – but also through that public confidence in this system and the fact that Parliament is seen to be scrutinising these matters openly and with some results at the end of the day.

103, 19. Progress of SIS II and VIS (debate) ,"  Sarah Ludford,  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, I have never had so much speaking time in one evening in all my 10 years in the European Parliament! Ten minutes in total is an unaccustomed luxury, and I am not sure I will be able to use it.I, too, am grateful to Vice-President Barrot for coming to report to us on the problems, although I feel we should not have had to keep asking for those updates. Anyone who has the merest familiarity with the installation of large IT works in the public sector in their own Member State will know that all these technical and budgetary problems frequently arise. Unfortunately, however, when you have two such high-profile, big systems – the Schengen Information System (SIS) II and the visa information system (VIS) – being affected, this also affects the credibility not only of the Union’s internal security – and I will come back to that later – but also of the EU’s visa policy.As rapporteur on the VIS, I can say that we were under pressure to get the legislation done in time, because we wanted to press ahead with having the VIS up and running – as it should have been by now – and any slippage in the programme is deeply disappointing.I would like to ask Commissioner Barrot what the implications are going to be for visa applicants. Are we going to end up with a lot of confused people, because the VIS is destined to deal with 20 million visa applications a year and delays presumably have a knock-on effect? And what about the outsourcing arrangements which are being established? You mentioned that there have been contractual penalties imposed owing to the delays in the visa information system. Could you tell us what those penalties are? What are the estimated extra costs envisaged? And could you tell us, Commissioner Barrot, whether overall, you have continued confidence in the contractor, or are we looking at a potential cancellation of the contract?This presumably also has implications for the setting-up of the agency for the common management of the SIS and VIS – and, potentially, other databases in the future. Perhaps some of the ambitions for the collection of data and large-scale surveillance systems might have to be looked at again, which would be no bad thing from the privacy point of view if we are going to have all these technical and infrastructure problems.The last thing I wanted to ask the Commissioner is this: the current estimate is that the SIS II will be in operation in the last quarter of 2011. We can, I guess, expect some further slippage. In the summer of 2012, the Olympics are being held in London. The UK Government did not take the opportunity to go into SIS I for reasons best known to itself. It actually had quite a few years when it could have gone into SIS I but said ‘oh no, no, we will wait till SIS II’.In answers to me, the Government has said that it is not worried about any implications for security. However, not only UK but also European security could be put at risk if the UK does not participate in access to the policing side – which it is allowed to do – of the Schengen Information System, by a time well ahead of the London Olympics taking place in 2012.Could you tell us, Commissioner Barrot, what you think the implications could be for security around the Olympics, which, especially as they are being held in London, and not least in my constituency, I am greatly concerned about?

Progress of SIS II and VIS (debate) ,"  Cornelia Ernst,  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. – (DE) Madam President, first I should like to say that we do not share the concerns of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is perfectly simple: we believe that further development towards SIS II is not necessary and is politically wrong. We take this view for three reasons: firstly, because it mixes secret service and police data, giving rise to a data system that no longer guarantees controllability and in which personal data is not, in fact, protected.The second is biometric data, which is being anchored here as a large-scale experiment and, thirdly, SIS II is, of course, to be used against so-called illegal immigration. Hence our proposal: as we all know, we have SIS I. We consider it reasonable to develop this further ‘as one for all’. It is a pragmatic approach, even if we are strongly criticised for it. However, we believe that, with the approach being pursued here, nothing more can be done. To put it simply: SIS II is a de facto failure and to keep on crawling round it – to put it one way – is meaningless. What is important is that money which is being put to the wrong use here should be saved, which will mean we have fewer problems with the whole thing and can stop worrying about the delay with SIS II. I say this also from the point of view of Saxony, a region of Germany close to Poland and the Czech Republic.

Progress of SIS II and VIS (debate) ,"  Carlos Coelho  (PPE).   – (PT) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Vice-President Barrot for his statement, although he is in an unfair position, because it would also be good to hear the Council’s position. Clearly, it is easier to exercise parliamentary scrutiny of the Commission than of the Council.In December 2001, the Commission was given a mandate to introduce the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS), which was expected to come into operation in March 2007. There have been many problems and delays. The new system is still not working. Some people predict that it will not be running before 2012, while others question the very viability of the project. There are now delays not only in SIS, but also in the Visa Information System (VIS), as both projects are being developed by the same company.I must say here that I continue to have confidence in Vice-President Barrot. In his political life, he has always shown himself to be competent, serious and a true pro-European. We know that he did not initiate the SIS project; he inherited it when he accepted a change of portfolio at the request of President Barroso. However, the services of the European Commission and the company contracted to develop the central system should clearly be held to account.Parliament has budgetary authority, and we have the right and the obligation to seek an explanation from the European Commission. Why do we need SIS II? We need better control of our external borders, we need more security, we need biometric data, and we need alerts to be interlinked. Two global technical tests, the so-called milestone tests, are planned, the first on 22 December, and the second in the summer of 2010. The aim of the first test is to check the smooth, reliable and effective operation of SIS II under operational conditions, for a period of 72 hours, and to check that the vital core features and data consistency can function without any problems or interruptions.This raises a number of questions. First, is there any risk that might jeopardise the implementation of the test in December of this year? Secondly, in order to lower the risk, is the possibility of reducing the level of requirements or even the number of states participating in the test being considered? Thirdly, can these new tests be considered part of the annual contract with the company, or will they be regarded as additional requirements, incurring extra costs? Fourthly, has the detection of problems and technical errors led to additional services being added to the contract? How much money has been paid out on these grounds? Fifthly, what was the total amount of the penalties imposed on the contractor – as mentioned by Vice-President Barrot – for the delays and technical errors that caused the previous tests to be unsuccessful? In the sixth place, does the Commission consider that, if there is a switch to implement an alternative solution, this will mean the termination of the contract with Steria?

What we need for this is 100% transparency, as well as clear language for those implementing the project on the Commission’s behalf, and that must also mean that, where necessary, there are financial consequences for these project managers.

109, 19. Progress of SIS II and VIS (debate) ,"  Edit Bauer  (PPE).   – (HU) Madam President, Commissioner, in 2006, when the new Member States were waiting to join the Schengen area, we stipulated, and it was stipulated to us, that one of the conditions was that SIS II had to be in operation. In the meantime, it transpired that the system would be unable to operate at all. We then heard that the floor was not strong enough to support the weight of the technical equipment and certainly, if the Portuguese Presidency had not come up with a solution for operating the ‘SIS one for all’ system, the eight new Member States would still have been waiting to join the Schengen area even now.Meanwhile, we should remember that new contracts had to be signed, new financial packages had to be found for developing the SIS II system, while the operation of the SIS I+ system still has to be financed. Therefore, in practical terms, we are financing two systems, which is costing European taxpayers no small sum of money. We are obviously talking about a large investment when it comes to safeguarding European citizens’ safety. Unlike my left-wing fellow Member, I feel that it can bring about a huge change in terms of quality for the benefit of European security.I am also curious about the delay given that in 2001, the system’s development was planned to take five years, from 2002 to 2007. We are now talking about it being developed perhaps over 10 years. Commissioner, it is not possible to have such a degree of uncertainty with a technical system that its development time doubles. We are well aware that technical gremlins can throw a spanner in the works and that public investment has been delayed, but we ultimately need to ask the question: what is the reason behind this? Are not some countries, some Member States in fact, deliberately stalling the SIS II system’s development? To simply conclude my question, what guarantee is there that we will not have the same story with the VIS system?

Progress of SIS II and VIS (debate) ,"  Elżbieta Katarzyna Łukacijewska  (PPE).   – (PL) Madam President, in view of the delays and problems in completing work on SIS II, and of forecasts which say that it will not be fully functional by the end of 2011, and even, as some are saying, by 2015, it has been decided to conduct tests on SIS II before the end of this year which will assess its functionality. If SIS II proves to be defective, it is said that an alternative plan will be introduced, based on improvements to SIS I.This, therefore, raises several questions. Is the European Commission ready to implement an alternative plan? What will be done about the investments made by Member States which have borne costs associated with the purchase of equipment to service the new system? Will this equipment be used in the alternative plan? Finally, how does the Commission intend to exact contractual penalties on those responsible for the project?

111, 19. Progress of SIS II and VIS (debate) ,"  Jacques Barrot,  Member of the Commission. – (FR) Madam President, I cannot reply to all of the questions that have been put to me, given that we find ourselves at a difficult moment in time. With regard to VIS, it is the tests which affect the central system and which must be performed by 11 November, and for SIS II, it is the milestone, that is to say, this criterion that must be fulfilled by the end of the year.Firstly, I am very grateful to all of the speakers. I want the European Parliament to have full access to all of the information. I would remind you that these two major systems were devised by the Member States precisely so that they could enjoy freedom of movement in secure conditions, as Mr Busuttil and Mr Moraes, in particular, pointed out.I would firstly like to try to respond on VIS, and in particular to Mrs Ludford, who, as rapporteur, has taken a particular interest in this problem. What we can say is that tests will be carried out on VIS by 11 November, and these tests will tell us whether we ought to change course. Until now, VIS can be thought of as having a sound architecture and, in fact, a few bugs, but ones that can be put right. Nevertheless, it is these tests that will show whether we need to terminate the contract with the contractor. It is too soon to tell, but the timetable would be reviewed accordingly in that instance.I would point out that, in 2005, the Council decided that VIS had to be rolled out in a consistent and coordinated fashion by the Member States. That is why the VIS regulation stipulates that the system will begin operating in the first region on the date set by the Commission once all of the Member States have notified it that they have made all the technical and legal adjustments necessary to use VIS in that region.This means that VIS will begin operating in the first region – North Africa, which covers the countries presenting the biggest risks in terms of illegal immigration and security – on the same date for all the Member States. This leads me to say that it really is important for all of the Member States to be able to get up and running and manage VIS because it would be extremely damaging if the central system proved to work normally but we were forced to extend the deadline even further because of these delays on the part of a few Member States. Hence, I am somewhat insistent on this point.I note that Mrs Ludford made particular reference to the problem of the Olympic Games. I sincerely hope that we will have made progress by then. However, it is true that provision has been made for the United Kingdom to connect to SIS I + ahead of the Olympic Games, if such action proves necessary.What I would also like to say is that, with regard to visa applicants, we sincerely hope not to deviate too much from the deadline that was set, since that is very important for us, and the serious risk of people ‘shopping’ for visas at consulates may increase if we delay VIS too much.Mrs Ždanoka talked to me about biometric data and controlling access to the system. I think that we will have an opportunity to discuss this again, but these controls will be subject to a number of clear rules. I noted that Mrs Ernst is against the system, but I wish to remember what Mr Kirkhope told me, also. I now come to Mr Coelho. Mr Coelho is well acquainted with SIS II, and I would like to try to answer some of his questions while keeping the option open to write to him in order to give him the other answers to his seven questions.What I can say is that the Commission opened the contractual negotiations with its co-contractor and that those negotiations were focused on two areas: the commissioning of the additional services and equipment required to perform the test of the first milestone, and an amendment to the basic contract to enable the milestones within SIS II to be formalised by contract. We reached an overall agreement at the end of July. We reached an overall agreement at the end of July, and it is true that the co-contractor pointed out that there were specifications that seemed to make the achievement of this first milestone a very complicated business. Nonetheless, we signed a contract with the contractor that stipulates that this milestone must be achieved.The analysis and repair period made it clear, however, that SIS II was built on solid, though at times excessively complex, foundations, and that, although some efforts needed to be made, the system was repairable.This in-depth analysis enabled us to identify several ways of improving the system, but it is true, Mr Coelho – and I say this to the whole of Parliament also – that we have a very ambitious project before us in this area, and that it is not easy to see exactly what is going to happen.I can say, however, that we have imposed contractual penalties on the Hewlett-Packard-Steria consortium in order to punish it, on the one hand, for its inability to bring the system up to the contractually required level at the end of the contractual phase of the operational tests on the ST and, on the other – for the time being, in any case – for the delays caused in the internal VIS tests.Both of these projects are governed by the same contract, so the penalties are deducted equally from the invoices for SIS II and for VIS. These penalties amount to almost EUR 3.5 million, and the penalty meter keeps on ticking in the case of VIS, while that of SIS II has been switched off since the start of the analysis and repair exercise begun in January. Should these projects have to be abandoned, the co-contractor will obviously have to bear the corresponding costs.Madam President, as things stand, and given what I said in respect both of VIS, about the tests that are going to take place by 11 November, and of SIS II, about the aim of confirming, via the end-of-year milestone, whether the architecture really is viable, I am unable to provide a more precise answer, since we are now at the stage of carrying out these tests and of preparing for the milestone.I wish to say that Parliament is welcome to help us spur on the co-contractor. As you have seen, I am very determined and I have become personally involved in this matter. I hope that, as in the case of Galileo, I will succeed more or less in saving both of these projects, which are very interesting in technological terms and which would enable Europe to benefit from a high-performance system, but I cannot be sure of that yet, this evening.Parliament is also welcome to help us spur on the Member States: as regards VIS, we are finding that the longest delays are being caused at the moment by a few Member States.Madam President, I am well aware that I have not answered every single question, but I remain fully at Parliament’s disposal to provide all the information that the MEPs and, in particular, those who put questions to me this evening, want, as and when I receive it.
