2, 2. Mutual recognition of professional qualifications (debate) ,"  Malcolm Harbour,  author. – Mr President, with your permission, I would propose that we delay a moment or two because this is an oral question to the Commission and we were hoping that Mr McCreevy would be here, but I see that Mr Samecki is going to speak. I have not met Mr Samecki before, so I am interested that he is here to provide an answer to an issue that Mr McCreevy and his team have been working on. Thank you very much.I was going to have welcomed Mr McCreevy here and thanked him for his work previously, so perhaps you will pass on our good wishes for what might have been his final appearance here. Nevertheless, I am particularly pleased that Mr Barnier has joined us as a very active member of my committee to hear this, because this is a dossier which will be very much in his in-tray, assuming of course that the Parliament approves his nomination and the Commission moves forward. It is nevertheless very good that he is here.The free movement of professionals and the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications are among the flagship issues that my committee is most concerned about in the whole construction of the single market. It is very appropriate that we are discussing this question to the Commission this morning, which is essentially to ask for an update on the progress in transposing the revised directive that my committee worked on back in 2004-2005, and on how that is actually being implemented by the Member States. It is also very timely because Professor Monti came to our committee on Monday to talk about his mission for the President of the Commission on the future direction of the internal market. He made a very strong point that part of the problem with the internal market is actually not the lack of legislation, but the consistent enforcement and effectiveness of the existing instruments that we have in place to create the internal market.In the case of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, as the text of our question quite clearly sets out, we already know that a significant number of problems in relation to recognition of professional qualifications are encountered by citizens across the European Union. It has one of the highest levels of complaints in the Solvit mechanism that we very much support at member government level. Many people feel frustrated by the absence of clear decisions and also by the lack of contact between authorisation bodies in different Member States. One of the things that our own research has done, and this committee commissioned research on this topic, is to demonstrate the fact that there is nothing like enough coordinated activity on helping people to recognise their rights under mutual recognition. The other aspect is that it is also clear from the work we and others have done that not enough professions are actually thinking in terms of moving into a European qualifications framework. There are serious questions that we need to ask about the mechanism, about how simple it is to access and about how effective it is in practical terms. We know from the statistics and the information – and I am sure we will hear from the Commission shortly – that transposition of this instrument has been delayed in just about every Member State. It has taken much longer than people expected to bring this into operation, and that of itself raises concerns about the complexity of the instrument itself.Just to pull all these things together in the context of the work of the Internal Market Committee over the next five years, I am delighted that, I think, all the coordinators of the committee are here today and I want to thank them for the work they have done, together with myself, on shaping the forward agenda for this committee. This question of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not just a one-off. It is part of our feeling that the role of our committee is to continue to investigate, to promote and to make recommendations about the future evolution of the key legislations, the key building blocks of the single market.We know that the Commission is due to review the mutual recognition directive in 2011. We plan to have a meeting of national parliaments and national parliamentarians to discuss this proposal. We have already had a hearing on this and we have our research report. These are the instruments that my committee can use and, if the coordinators agree, I am sure that we will be doing an own-initiative report sometime in 2010 to feed into this discussion that the Commission will have.That is the context of the question. We look forward to hearing the Commission’s reply to set the framework for that, but this is just the beginning of the process and I am sure that the new Commissioner will be able to take that forward and work with us to really develop this crucial piece of legislation and make the single market work better.

3, 2. Mutual recognition of professional qualifications (debate) ,"  Paweł Samecki,  Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for raising these important questions.Before responding to the individual questions, let me start with an overview. The objective of the Professional Qualifications Directive is to facilitate the free movement of our citizens in the internal market. Two years after the end of the transposition period, transposition is complete in 22 Member States, and four Member States will hopefully deliver by the end of the year. At this stage I am, however, concerned about Greece, from which we have not received any transposition measure yet.Let me now turn to the first question. The transposition has constituted a challenge for Member States mainly because it affects more than 800 different professions. These professions have often even been regulated in federal or regional laws. However, this cannot be an excuse for any delays, and the Court of Justice has not accepted such delays in six judgments so far.Concerning the second question, the main problems relate to the health professions and architects, where a higher degree of harmonisation of training requirements at European level is in place. Problems also occur in professions with higher levels of cross-border mobility of workers such as teachers or tourist guides.On the third question, the priority of the Commission is to ensure correct and consistent implementation of the directive. To this end, we have developed a code of conduct on administrative practices and a user guide addressed to citizens, which will also promote more consistency.As to the obstacles which Solvit identified, we are fully aware of problems on the ground, such as delays occurring in the recognition procedure, lack of response from the national competent authorities, unsubstantiated decisions, lost files, etc. Sometimes, erroneous information is even given to migrants and they are invited to follow wrong procedures. However, the Solvit network has proven to be effective in solving many of these problems.But there is not only Solvit. National contact points are now in place in all Member States to inform and assist citizens, and the Commission expects them to be even more active in the future. Moreover, the Internal Market Information System has also provided a medium for supporting more than 1 200 information exchanges for many of the regulated professions this year. This has brought about enhancements in day-to-day administrative cooperation between Member States.Finally, on the last question, the Commission is not in a position to assess whether there is a need for reform at the moment. This will be done during an ex post evaluation exercise foreseen by the directive. Our intention is certainly to respect the timetable set in the directive. It will be up to the next Commission to decide how to take this forward.

4, 2. Mutual recognition of professional qualifications (debate) ,"  Kurt Lechner,  on behalf of the PPE Group. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2005, we adopted this directive after several years of work and debate in Parliament and it came into force. In 2007, it was implemented. Now we have reached 2009 and it is hard to accept that the directive has not been implemented everywhere, particularly since it was not completely new, because there were already proposals in place. I can only encourage the Commission to exert more pressure on the Member States.I had expected that the problems would lie in the practical management of the directive. That is the main subject of the forthcoming investigations: to find out where there are specific local problems and to discover what is actually happening. There has already been a reference to the fact that 20% of the complaints to SOLVIT concern this subject. This is a very serious matter. Mr Harbour rightly pointed out – and I do not want to repeat what he said – the importance of this problem for the internal market from an economic perspective.However, apart from the economic issues, it is also one of the fundamental freedoms of citizens to be able to exercise their profession and to fulfil their potential in another state, for example, when they marry or move to another country for some other reason. This is a genuine problem for the citizens of Europe.It is important for us to acknowledge that there will inevitably be problems. It is a complex matter, it takes time to implement and different cultures and traditions are involved, particularly with regard to the professions and the concepts of quality and qualifications within those professions. Therefore, it is not possible to recognise every qualification from one country in another country without question. For me and for us, this is less about dealing with the individual cases of hardship which will inevitably occur and more about investigating – and this is where SOLVIT comes in – whether there are faults in the structures or in the system and whether and how improvements can be introduced.I would like to point out that it will never be possible to bring this subject to a close. It is a long-running issue because new professions and new job descriptions are, of course, constantly coming into existence. For this reason, this is an ongoing task for the Commission and for Parliament, but also for the Member States, whose goodwill I would like to call on at this point.

There is still a great deal to be done by the European Commission in this respect.I would like to draw attention to one point which is very important to me and which we have repeatedly brought up in Parliament.

6, 2. Mutual recognition of professional qualifications (debate) ,"  Cristian Silviu Buşoi,  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – (RO) The free movement of persons is one of the fundamental rights of the European Union’s citizens. This also includes the free movement of professionals, which is a vital condition for ensuring that the internal market operates as efficiently as possible.As has been mentioned in all the speeches made so far, in spite of the adoption of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications in 2005, professionals wishing to exercise their right of free movement are still encountering numerous difficulties. I have personally come across various cases of this type, which have been brought to my knowledge not only by Romanian citizens, but also by European citizens, relating to a variety of professions.My colleagues from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection did the honour of appointing me as rapporteur for the European Solvit network. As has been mentioned so far, a significant proportion of the cases which Solvit has to resolve are linked to failures in the system for mutual recognition of professional qualifications.I believe, fellow Members, that we need to analyse in detail the problems which have been submitted to the Solvit centres so that we can see what we can improve.Better communication is also needed between contact points in order to promote mutual understanding between Member States. They must understand how the other systems work in the European Union so that the maximum possible flexibility can be used when applying the directive, as well as to avoid the administrative obstacles blocking the professionals’ path.Lastly, it would be desirable for the five Member States which have not yet completed transposition of the directive, or any state among the 22 which has done this but is still having problems with transposition or has transposed it inappropriately, to quickly rectify these situations. The ultimate aim is to facilitate the smooth operation of the internal market for the provision of services which is directly affected by problems relating to the recognition of professional qualifications.

7, 2. Mutual recognition of professional qualifications (debate) ,"  Heide Rühle,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I think we all agree on the objective here. Of course, we all want the citizens of Europe to be able to move about freely and to exercise their professions. The question is why this directive has still not been properly implemented after four or now nearly five years. I believe it would make sense if the committee was involved not only in drawing up and enacting the legislation, but if it also carried out an analysis afterwards of the reasons why transposition is delayed in this way.The Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications is not the only directive which is causing problems. When there are so many cases in the Court of Justice of the European Union, when there are so many complaints procedures and when SOLVIT is so heavily involved with this subject, this should act as a wake-up call for us. We must look more closely at the reasons behind this. There are a number of causes. On the one hand, it is always very easy to say that the Member States are responsible for the delay. Protectionism is doubtless another of the reasons. The different cultures and legal systems certainly also play a role. What effect does European legislation have on these differing legal systems? That is another issue that we will have to address.In addition, we must consider whether the directive has had the intended effect or whether it was incapable of achieving certain results right from its conception. I believe it is very important that we look at this issue again. This type of ex-ante analysis is one of the important subjects which this committee will have to deal with and make progress on.However, I also have questions for the Commission. I am surprised that these guidelines are only appearing after more than four years. This could have been done much earlier. However, I do welcome the guidelines.

8, 2. Mutual recognition of professional qualifications (debate) ,"  Adam Bielan,  on behalf of the ECR Group. – (PL) Mr President, the crisis which has affected the European Union in recent months has shown irrefutably how important the internal market is for the functioning of the entire Union. We will not finish building it without introducing a certain freedom for people to migrate, which is guaranteed, among others, by the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Therefore, it is a sad and disturbing fact that, four years after adoption of the directive, it still is not in force in four countries, and none of the Member States adopted it before the deadline contained in the directive, 20 October 2007.In relation to this, my first question to the European Commission is as follows: has the Commission not been too passive over the last four years, and what exactly did the Commission do so that all the countries would manage to transpose the directive in time? Secondly, I would like to ask when the Commission will publish a report evaluating transposition of the directive, and what will be used as the basis for the conclusions in the report? The Services Directive should be implemented at the end of the year. Today, in Parliament, we know already that many countries will not manage to pass laws about this in time. I would like to ask what connection the Commission sees between these two documents?Finally, a very important matter for the country I represent is the question of migration of nurses.

However, I would also like to point out that, following the interinstitutional agreement between the Commission and Parliament, and I have seen this happen with the Services Directive, which we discussed in Brussels months ago, Parliament has a right to demand that the Commissioner responsible should be here to answer difficult questions. I do not think that we can resolve this issue with this Commission and there is no point in trying to do so.On behalf of Parliament, I would like to explain to the representative of the Commission who is here that we believe that this part of the interinstitutional agreement is extremely important. Why is that? Not for reasons of mere formalism, but because this is a very important political question for the citizens of the European Union. Mr Bielan has just referred to the Services Directive, which can only function if professional qualifications are recognised by both sides. It is of great importance, but many people also connect it with a feeling of helplessness, if they have the impression that their employer is making use of discrepancies in the cross-border mutual recognition of professional qualifications simply to reduce their earnings.These people feel abandoned and helpless. I have seen this myself in a number of cases here on the border between Germany and France. However, this is obviously not the only problem area. It is true that we cannot resolve all the difficulties overnight and that this process will remain an ongoing issue in future, as Mr Lechner, the rapporteur, has said. Nevertheless, it is our job to show the citizens that we take their concerns seriously and, in my opinion, this also includes the Commission attaching sufficient importance to this issue.I hope that we will be able to work together with the new Commission on this in order to make progress.

10, 2. Mutual recognition of professional qualifications (debate) ,"  Bernadette Vergnaud  (S&D).   – (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already discussed the fears linked to the transposition of the Services Directive. In this sense, the example of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications is symbolic. Some States have failed to respect the transposition deadline and are having problems due to the gaps in the text. Although this directive lays a solid foundation for mutual recognition, the specific characteristics of certain professions have not been taken into account. The fact is, recognising qualifications without having established actual common levels of qualification and training, including for higher education, can only cause complications and create mistrust on the part of Member States, professionals and the citizens.The most obvious example is that of the medical professions. For example, French midwives are authorised to write prescriptions and are trained for that, which is not the case in other countries. What happens when a midwife without such authorisation arrives in France without additional training and has to write a medical prescription? Similarly, certain specialisms do not exist in every Member State.This directive is crucial to the free movement of workers, the foundation on which the European project is based, but it must be improved and enhanced, and the difficulties encountered must serve to identify the professions for which language teaching and harmonised training are necessary.I should like to mention the remarkable initiative, which is supported by all health professionals, to create a European card. This is a genuine guarantee as much for the carrier as for the customer or patient, and I call on the Commission to extend it to other professions, since this will enable us to improve mutual recognition and to gain the citizens’ trust.

Mutual recognition of professional qualifications (debate) ,"  Antonyia Parvanova  (ALDE).   – Mr President, when discussing the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and the good functioning of the internal market, we have to look at the current situation in the health sector, for which the directive and its implementation may need to be further discussed.In addition to the full implementation of this directive, it is crucial to introduce further measures applying to mutual recognition, not only of diplomas, but of health professionals’ qualifications as well. The provision of health services requires appropriate linguistic skills, registration through national regulators and, most importantly, the ability to deliver safe and high-quality care.I think there is a need for better sharing of information between Member States regarding health professionals’ registration, for example through a common EU database. A competence assurance system is also a key element of safe health care services provision, and we should think about common standards for the assessment of competences and skills.Health professionals’ mobility is also a question of public health and public safety. On these grounds, the ECJ has already approved additional national safeguards for the circulation of goods. There is also a rationale for such measures applying to the provision of health services, especially when new communication technologies allow controversial practices such as e-doctor consultations. We have to face the challenge of an ageing population, and this will put even more pressure on the European health workforce.While ensuring the mobility of health professionals, we must also be able to guarantee to all European citizens accessible health services, timely delivered with the highest quality standards.

I understand the scale of the problem perfectly. The 800 regulated professions of which Mr Samecki spoke, together with numerous regulations of these professions at national and regional level, are a considerable challenge for the administrations of the Member States. However, the challenge for our citizens who are having problems with recognition of their qualifications is, principally, how to find their feet in the complexities of the entire system. This is confirmed by data from Solvit, and this is why the problem with implementing the directive in time is only one aspect of our discussion.We should not, however, forget that many problems are emerging because there is a lack of trust in Member States towards the education and training systems in other Member States. We lack, finally, cooperation, resources and the engagement of national administrations. The introduction of a European professional card is a good idea, and we had the opportunity to discuss this during the previous term of the European Parliament. Such a card must, however, facilitate the flow of people, and not make it more difficult. Introduction of this card – and I would like to stress this very strongly – should not become another barrier in the internal market.Ladies and gentlemen, in just under ten days, the deadline for transposition of the Services Directive expires. I mention this because it is also important in the context of our debate today. These two directives complement each other in certain respects.

The question is: why is this directive, which is so important and so universally longed-for, difficult to apply? Well, quite simply because it is difficult and complex to apply in everyday, operational terms.I see three main problems: the first is obviously language, a point that has been raised; the second is the complexity of the procedures to be followed to have a person’s qualifications recognised as valid – at times, people have to literally jump through hoops to have their initial diplomas recognised; and the third is perhaps the variety of types of initial training.In this regard, I think it would be a good idea for the Commission to ask the Member States to appoint, for each profession, a single competent professional body to be in charge of continuing training – continuing training being one of the solutions. These competent bodies should be asked to sit as a board, at European level, to define a common European form of certification.

26, 3. The cohesion policy after 2013 (debate) ,"  Danuta Maria Hübner,  author. – Mr President, three years ago, a major reform of European cohesion policy was introduced taking into account the unprecedented enlargement of the Union and new emerging challenges.It was not by chance that, back in 2005 and 2006, the top priorities for European cohesion policy were: the Lisbon strategy, innovation and competitiveness, climate change, energy security and efficiency, water efficiency, investment in new skills, attractiveness of territories for young people, and quality of life.It is because we have understood that the mission of cohesion policy is to anticipate change, not to follow it, that we have put on the cohesion policy agenda for 2007-2013 all those priorities which we see today in the Commission’s Europe 2020 agenda.That is why, more than two years ago, the Regions 2020 analytical report was published. The purpose was to know what the cohesion policy priorities should be after 2013. Today, we are well prepared to face the future.A year ago, the policy put all its assets at the disposal of the European Recovery Package, thereby also providing the essential link between the exit strategy from a real economic crisis, on the one hand, and long-term sustainable growth and structural transformation on the other.But our oral question is about the future. In years to come, the Europe we live in will be in need of strong collective action to respond to the expectations of its citizens, who are today informed citizens, fully aware of how much depends on choices made by policy makers. Those expectations are confirmed by public opinion polls.Jacques Delors once said that the European single market is about competition that stimulates, about cooperation that makes us stronger and about solidarity that makes us united. European cohesion that makes the single market work is delivered by the European regional policy, which is today based exactly on this triple foundation: competitiveness, cooperation and solidarity.For years, we have talked about the need to unlock, to mobilise, the development potential of all European regions and cities. Experience and logic clearly show that this mobilisation turns out to be most effective and efficient if pursued through the direct engagement of subnational levels of European governments.The European regional policy has already passed the subsidiarity test. Subsidiarity works for Europe.The 2006 reform of cohesion policy has made it a modern place-based policy founded on a balance between equity and efficiency, between bottom-up and top-down approaches, between common strategic European objectives and local flexibility.There is a need to move further on those issues, to continue the reform of policy governance, but certain principles should not be abandoned. The new treaty has cemented the new understanding of European subsidiarity already deeply rooted in the cohesion policy, that is, subsidiarity extended to local and regional levels of governance.We can do more on it, especially with regard to the local level. Those who suggest that cohesion policy can be limited to Brussels and national level either do not know the European reality, or do not understand that excluding local and regional Europe from the pursuit of common European objectives is economically at best unwise and politically dangerous.Cohesion is a notion that excludes exclusion. For political, economic, social and legitimacy reasons, cohesion policy must not be divisive: it should be a policy for all, as the internal market is, as the common currency is.All elements of this integration triangle – common market, common currency, cohesion – are mutually strengthening and interdependent. They are our common European public good.We policy makers have raised the stakes by promising to deliver. The challenges are well known; the EU 2020 strategy has been opened to public consultations.Development policy with clear targets and tools is needed. Cohesion policy is a policy for development that engages all levels of European governance working in concert for European citizens.To conclude, Europe needs new energy to take care of its future, to renew itself in an assertive way. It is legitimate to ask where this energy could and should come from. For me, the answer is clear. Today, this energy should come from below. Today this energy can be released through the direct engagement of local and regional levels of European governance in the pursuit of common European objectives.

27, 3. The cohesion policy after 2013 (debate) ,"  Paweł Samecki,  Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the questions put forward are very pertinent. They underline the importance you attach to cohesion policy as well as your dedication to keep the policy at the heart of European integration.As regards your question on multi-level governance, multi-level governance has been recognised as a fundamental mechanism in delivering EU policy priorities. The growing interdependence between different levels of government in the Union was stressed by the consultation paper launched by the Commission on the EU 2020 strategy.Cohesion policy is a good example of multi-level governance. It offers a governance system which values and exploits local and regional knowledge, combines it with strategic direction from the Community level, and coordinates interventions between levels of government.The strengths of multi-level governance were also stressed by the Committee of the Regions in its White Paper of June 2009, where it called on the Union to strengthen mechanisms of multi-level governance and pointed to the leverage effects generated by cohesion policy, which contributed to the implementation of other Community policies as well.On your two questions concerning the eventual abandonment of Objective 2 and the eligibility of all European regions, in the period 2007-2013, all regions are eligible for structural funds support. Concerning the period post-2013, there is no official Commission position at this stage.As regards your third question on the weakening of the principle of additionality, additionality is one of the basic principles of cohesion policy. It ensures that the structural funds do not replace the public or equivalent structural expenditure by a Member State. Thus, it guarantees the genuine economic impact of EU interventions and provides cohesion policy with an important European added value.As to your question on the regional dimension of cohesion policy after 2013, the Lisbon Treaty maintains the objective of reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions as part of the Union’s remit on economic, social and territorial cohesion under Article 174.In addition, Article 176 points out that the European Regional Development Fund is intended to help to redress the main regional imbalances in the Union through participation in the development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind and in the conversion of declining industrial regions.As regards your question on the involvement of regional and local levels of governance in the pursuit of European objectives within the framework of post-2013 cohesion policy, once again, I would like to draw your attention to the Commission’s consultation paper on the EU 2020 strategy, which looks for the active support of stakeholders, such as the social partners and civil society, and recognises that the take-up of the EU 2020 vision across all the regions of the EU will also be crucial to its success.The Commission has not yet developed a position on what role cohesion policy will play in the delivery of the EU 2020 strategy. But the cohesion policy has the capacity to mobilise regional or local actors across all boundaries in pursuit of European objectives.In relation to your question whether the Commission intends to publish a White Paper on Territorial Cohesion, at the current stage, a separate White Paper on Territorial Cohesion is not foreseen. Policy conclusions resulting from the public debate on the Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion will instead be incorporated in the comprehensive cohesion policy legislative package for post-2013 prepared in the context of the Fifth Cohesion Report which, according to the new treaty, is due for submission in 2010.On your question concerning the role of the European Social Fund in cohesion policy, in pursuing the objective of balanced and sustainable development, cohesion policy plays a crucial role in the delivery of European priorities. This is also the case for the European Social Fund, which will continue to pursue its objectives as defined by Title XI of the new treaty.Achieving social, economic and territorial cohesion requires appropriate policies and a mix of investments from various levels. Human capital investments financed by the ESF form an essential component of this policy mix in the context of the global knowledge-based economy.With regard to your question on the role of cohesion policy in relation to other EU policies, cohesion policy provides the EU with its largest source of investment in the real economy. The December 2008 communication of the Commission on ‘Cohesion policy: investing in real economy’, underlined the importance of the policy for focusing on the EU Lisbon Agenda delivery, investing in people, business, research and innovation, priority infrastructures and energy.The Commission’s current focus is on ensuring that the implementation of the planned investments can be delivered in partnership with national and regional authorities as effectively as possible. This effort involves close cooperation between relevant Commission services and between the Commission and relevant regional and local authorities.A practical example of cooperation between the Commission services is the ‘Practical Guide to EU funding opportunities for research and innovation’ published in 2007, which was conceived to help potential beneficiaries to find their way through the three funding Community instruments and provides policy makers with advice on coordinated access to those instruments.As far as the ESF is concerned, the close alignment of its priorities with the Employment Guidelines provides for a direct link between EU employment policy priorities and EU financial support.Complementarity also exists between actions supported by the cohesion policy and by the rural development policy as clearly set out in the Community Strategic Guidelines of both policies.I hope that I have responded to some of your questions and I look forward to an interesting debate.

28, 3. The cohesion policy after 2013 (debate) ,"  Lambert van Nistelrooij,  on behalf of the PPE Group. – (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, today’s debate primarily concerns the substantive assessment of the cohesion policy and the way ahead for this policy. Of course, the European Parliament wants a financial mid-term review. The cohesion policy and the use of the funds now and in this subsequent period up to 2020 forms a key part of this. However, much to our surprise, we found absolutely no mention of a substantive assessment in the ‘non-paper’ preparatory to the mid-term review. I should like to make clear, as the first speaker from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), that the new Commission must present the European Parliament with a substantive assessment rather than a caricature of regional policy.Commission President Barroso’s vision document EU 2020 envisages growth and a knowledge-based economy, equipping and training, competition and a green economy. Well, then, regional policy now and in the future constitutes the European integration framework for the realisation of these objectives. Look at energy transition, climate change and the Lisbon Strategy: these are all essential elements for regions and cities.As far as the PPE Group is concerned, we wish to focus the cohesion policy rather more on the key elements of this EU 2020 strategy, whilst retaining solidarity among all the regions and also Objective 2, about which the Commissioner spoke so vaguely just now. The promotion of competition in the rich regions forms part of the comprehensive assessment. Splitting budgets, increasing the sectoral fragmentation of funds at European level within the framework of such a mid-term review, serves no purpose whatsoever and is the wrong approach to take. In the present times of crisis, we are seeing how important regional funds are to recovery. These are being disbursed faster and are being fully utilised: in 2009, virtually 100% has been mobilised for innovation and new objectives in my region, the South Netherlands region. In early 2010, I myself shall be issuing a report on the synergy between regional funds and research and development.I should like to finish off with a question. Commissioner, you say you will not be presenting a White Paper on Territorial Cohesion, yet it is Parliament that will be dealing with this by means of the ordinary legislative procedure and ensuring that these things are laid down in the new regulations.

29, 3. The cohesion policy after 2013 (debate) ,"  Constanze Angela Krehl,  on behalf of the S&D Group. – (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would have liked to see a more exciting introduction to this topic, because I believe that the European cohesion policy must change after 2013. We are faced with quite different challenges than was the case 10 or 15 years ago.The focus for my group is on the fact that solidarity between the regions is not negotiable. On the one hand, this means that all the regions must have the opportunity to participate in the European Union cohesion policy and, on the other hand, it also means that we must oppose any attempt to renationalise the cohesion policy. We need a European approach which allows citizens to identify with the European Union.For us, there is no question that we also need to change. In the next few years, the spotlight will be on a discussion about prioritising the areas which will receive funding from the European cohesion policy. In future, we will not be able to subsidise everyone with European money. We must focus on establishing effective infrastructures, in particular, in the new Member States, and on developing research and innovation. Of course, we must also bear in mind that in future, the European cohesion policy will have to respond appropriately to challenges such as climate change, demographic change and globalisation.We also need to concentrate on urban development. This is not because I want to neglect rural areas, but because we know that 80% of citizens live in towns, cities and urban hinterlands and because rural development unfortunately does not form part of the cohesion policy at the moment, but is covered by agriculture policy. Our approach is to create stronger networks. I do not yet know whether this will work, but we must rise to the challenge.Importantly, support for people themselves also forms part of the cohesion policy and this is why I regret the fact that the Commissioner’s response was slightly evasive. For us, this means primarily education, training and qualifications for everyone from small children right through to the elderly. Life-long learning is an important concept. However, this also means that the European Social Fund (ESF) must continue to be integrated with the cohesion policy. There must be no thoughts of separating the ESF from the cohesion policy.Cross-border cooperation is very important to us.

The cohesion policy after 2013 (debate) ,"  Filiz Hakaeva Hyusmenovа,  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – (BG) Ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the reform of the Structural Funds is of fundamental importance in terms of the opportunity for the European Union to have financial instruments which are suitable for the economic situation, along with the relevant natural and human resources.We are faced with a tough task in forecasting and devising a cohesion policy which will promote citizens’ long-term prosperity. This policy was and still is one of the visible quantifiable indicators of European solidarity. However, the disparities between some regions are fairly extreme and we must not ignore this fact.What is alarming is that trends are being observed indicating that these disparities are growing, which may increase inequality and lead to isolation. As a representative of one of the poorest Member States in the European Union, I urge that one of the focuses of the cohesion policy will be cohesion between low-income Member States.I note that we are not looking at the Structural Funds as a panacea. It is clear to us that we need to join efforts and increase our pace towards achieving the European Union’s basic standards. We should also warn of the possibility that the fact that countries are moving at different speeds may lead, at a suitable moment, to an internal restructuring of the European Union.Above all, we must set criteria, simplified terms and an equal chance of acquiring resources from the EU funds. Only after this should a clause be added for reducing the support for countries which fail to make any progress. I feel it is appropriate, if some countries encounter difficulties while acting on their own, to have them included in areas and problems with a significantly transnational dimension.As a result, European resources will also be allocated to richer countries and their regions with a lower GDP. Ultimately, the results of the cohesion policy must also be measured in terms of employment generated. This is also an indicator of how it integrates with other policies and ensures added value.

32, 3. The cohesion policy after 2013 (debate) ,"  Elisabeth Schroedter,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, not much has been said about the significance of the European cohesion policy in Europe. It lies at the centre of the European Union, as it is the policy which holds the EU together at its heart. It is a symbol of solidarity and of overcoming national egoism. It is an instrument for all the regions. This is why the European Parliament is so concerned that this solidarity mechanism may simply be abolished behind our backs. It does not say much for good governance when the Commission secretly issues strategic documents, instead of holding an open debate about how we can continue with the solidarity mechanism in the light of the major challenges which face us, such as climate change and demographic change, given the tight budgetary constraints.We need reform, but it must result in genuine change. It must bring about sustainable development in the regions. It must provide the regions with support for their projects and not consist of top-down policy, in the way that this earmarking mechanism currently does. Instead, it must develop a bottom-up process in close partnership with all the players in the regions. We are familiar with this process. We already have the LEADER method for the development of rural areas. This is an excellent method for promoting sustainable development and getting everyone involved in order to ensure a very high level of local acceptance. However, we need a Commission which is brave enough to say yes to the solidarity mechanism and yes to the regions deciding on their own development, rather than this being the responsibility of national governments.

33, 3. The cohesion policy after 2013 (debate) ,"  Oldřich Vlasák,  on behalf of the ECR Group. – (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current cohesion policy is a living organism. As Europe changes, the position of individual states and groups changes in respect of this policy. Unfortunately, more questions than answers have emerged in discussions over the future of cohesion policy after 2014.Will cohesion policy continue to serve mainly the least developed regions of the Union? Will we have the opportunity to construct transport and technical infrastructure in the coming period? Will we manage to improve quality of life and make savings? Will we manage to reduce the bureaucracy and excessive administration connected with the drawing of EU funding? We will be looking for consensual answers to these and other questions in the very near future.From the perspective of future developments, I personally consider it vital firstly to align the role of local authorities correctly in managing European funds and secondly, to target European funds at supporting the use of modern technologies. It is precisely these two areas that are combined in the so-called Smart Cities initiative, which offers an opportunity to revitalise municipal authorities and, at the same time, to offer the business sector the opportunity in a period of economic crisis to apply modern systems and intelligent technologies and to generate economic growth. This is unquestionably a reason for focusing strategic investments on this area not only at a local authority level but also at a Member State and even EU level. Intelligent transport systems that can liberate cities from transport chaos, supportive navigation mechanisms that can increase the attractiveness of tourism in cities, and teleassistance systems enabling senior citizens to remain longer in their own homes are all types of investment that should be given the green light.As a result of the economic crisis, our debate on the future of the cohesion policy has become even more urgent than it ever was in the past.

The values given in statistics are often fictitious, as the European Union itself admits, which is why it created the transitional support regime for a series of regions, three of which are in my country, Greece.The rule of unequal development in the capitalist system is implacable, especially in times of crisis, during which contrasts are even more marked. Unfortunately, forecasts for 2013 are even worse for the workers, especially in less developed areas. The European Union’s cohesion policy tries to gloss over this anti-grassroots policy, to buy people off, to disorientate the workers and, more importantly, to secure the profitability of capital.The aim of temporarily ironing out the contrasts between sections of the plutocracy, misleadingly referred to as ‘solidarity’, is now being replaced by the rule of competition and the free market. These elements also exist in the Lisbon Strategy and the EU strategy for 2020.It calls for new forms of regional and local governance, as proposed in Greece by the PASOK and New Democracy parties, extended and more direct intervention by the European Union in regional bodies and differentiated territorial cooperation which will also cross national borders. We call on the workers to reject this policy.Finally, I should like to take advantage of my speaking time to call on you, Mr President, to exert your influence in obtaining satisfaction in the European Parliament of the just demands of the workers, who are taking to the streets.

35, 3. The cohesion policy after 2013 (debate) ,"  John Bufton,  on behalf of the EFD Group. – Mr President, regarding post-2013 cohesion policy, a leaked draft budgetary document entitled ‘A Reform Agenda for a Global Europe’ reveal that EU funding from 2013 onwards could change entirely to a nationally coordinated rather than regionally allocated distribution.The draft abandons regional and local level control in multi-level governance, overturning the shared management principle. Instead, a sectoral approach to the new budget is adopted rather than operating independently within current structures.The proposal to limit the policy to national level would lead to qualifying Member States governing redistribution. Not only does this mean that net contributors will lose further return funding, but those Member States expected to join the European Union under future expansion would enter membership under cohesion funding likely to remain for the forthcoming budgetary duration.As a result, those countries who currently shoulder a large proportion of the Union’s financial burden, like the UK, will discover they must finance an ever-increasing pool of Member States qualifying for support.Even fewer will have to carry even more, with a possible loss of the rebate for the UK. With more countries queuing up to join the EU, I am concerned Wales will see much needed support go to newer Member States.It is no surprise that some of Europe’s richest countries like Norway and Switzerland have given the European Union a wide berth, knowing that they would be paying to fund their poorer neighbours. But Wales cannot afford to pay if nothing is paid back out.The move reinforces the European Union’s increasing ambition to become further integrated, centralised and federal, yet abandons the regional dimension of cohesion policy which underpins the European Union’s pledge to support territorial cohesion and deliver benefits to all members.Instead the EU, like a wolf in sheep’s clothing, is covertly abandoning cooperation and compromise in favour of consolidation.Whereas the people of Europe were told the Union – on the grounds that it enhanced trade links – strengthened agriculture ties and promoted equality, the machinations of an increasing bureaucratic global Europe see the focus on farming and regional development decrease in favour of an unwanted ambitious global strategy, including increased emigration to countries like the UK.Larger shares of the EU budget will need to be devoted to such an agenda at the expense of regions such as Wales. The last payments to projects under the 2007-2013 EU structural funds programmes will be made in 2015. There is uncertainty over what, if any, subsequent EU funding will be available to Wales in future funding rounds.The implication that cohesion might disappear entirely from richer nations with no mention at all of transitional funding would further disenfranchise the people of the UK.The disproportionate membership bill would be better steered towards funding economic development through self-sufficiency determined by the UK itself.The EU budget review set to be published in the spring will likely see every government in Europe declare the necessity for increased public sector borrowing. It seems increasingly likely that the level of funding available to Wales will reduce substantially.The consequences will include reductions in programme budgets, less investment in the wider economy in Wales, and broad-reaching loss of jobs connected to programme management and project delivery.Rather than having any sort of beneficial effect on my constituents, the EU will serve a glancing blow to the people of Wales if they decide to pull the rug from under our feet. The likely result of the reduction in funding to Wales and the UK will have a major impact on our country as a whole which will affect the farming sector as well.It now must be time that the people of Wales and the UK have a referendum on its relations with the European Union so the people can decide if they want to be governed by Westminster or Brussels.

Many towns and rural regions would lack decisive incentives for structural change. The border regions with their problems of cross-border workers and cross-border infrastructure would simply be neglected. Social policy would no longer be able to benefit from European contributions to education and employment policy. Medium-sized companies would be prevented from taking part successfully in international networks.Without European regional policy, the communities in the regions would no longer be visible. For this reason, we are very annoyed by the signals coming from the Commission which include proposals for social programmes without the support of structural funding. This would turn the Commission into a social monopoly without the regions or would lead to calls for subsidy policy only for the weakest in our society. This, in turn, would mean that we would completely lose sight of the European context and we would return to the age of renationalisation.Whether or not the Commission has now made these documents public, the European Parliament will not lend its support to the move that they describe to a regional policy without the regions. This does not mean that we are closed to the idea of reform. New challenges relating to the environment, to energy policy or to demographic change must be integrated into our existing subsidy structures.

The choice is between the market and social policy. The Commission’s current ideas about the future of the cohesion policy are unacceptable. The structural funds must be strengthened and not weakened. Europe must do more and not less to overcome economic and social differences in development. I would like to say quite openly that the renationalisation even of parts of the current cohesion policy would have a serious impact on disadvantaged regions, including those in Germany and, in particular, eastern Germany. After the last phase of enlargement of the European Union, the differences between the regions in the Union have increased.In addition, it is important to me that, in particular, socio-economic requirements in the regions which are just above the eligibility threshold of 75% of the EU average GDP per head are recognised. The sudden removal of subsidies after 2013 would be devastating for these regions.Of course, it is extremely important for specific subsidies for towns to be increased by the European Union, as this is where the major potential for the economy and finance lies, because the towns have been particularly hard hit by the crisis.I would like to say one last word about the border regions.

The sudden removal of subsidies after 2013 would be devastating for these regions.', 'Of course, it is extremely important for specific subsidies for towns to be increased by the European Union, as this is where the major potential for the economy and finance lies, because the towns have been particularly hard hit by the crisis.', 'I would like to say one last word about the border regions. As a Member of Parliament from eastern Germany, I know that we need to invest and achieve a great deal there. I am very concerned that the Commission will fail us in this respect. ']"

The cohesion policy after 2013 (debate) ,"  Franz Obermayr  (NI).   – (DE) Mr President, you will probably have heard in the meantime that there is serious consternation and disquiet among the members of the Committee on Regional Development, because a so-called secret document from the Commission has been circulating since October. This document contains the draft of a budget reform for the period 2013-2020 which represents a U-turn in budget policy. The original regional focus of the budget has been replaced by a sectoral approach.The new draft represents a huge restriction on the principles of subsidiarity and multi-level governance, which is in contradiction to the Lisbon strategy. In specific terms, the draft includes plans to abolish Objective 2, in other words, competitiveness and employment policy. As there are Objective 2 regions in every Member State, this would, of course, sadly affect two thirds of all the EU regions. This unfortunate proposal is justified on the basis that the difference between new – or in other words, future – Member States and Western Europe at a national level is so great that a new budget policy is needed. In the light of the financial crisis, this is said to be a way of stimulating the economy.It seems obvious to me that this proposal is anticipating the possible accession of Turkey. We know that increased funding would be needed and this is a way of planning to ensure that the huge amounts of money required for the accession will be available.However, I would like to say quite clearly that at a regional level, the success of the cohesion policy lies in its proximity to local economic problems. As a result, money will be invested sensibly and efficiently, as it has been until now. If the regional component is not included, it will not be possible to bring an end to the economic crisis.I was not convinced by Mr Barroso’s answer to Mrs Hübner’s open letter, which indicated her concern, and, therefore, I expect to see a concrete statement soon.

Indeed, we believe that, to be effective, this policy must be reformed and enhanced. We, Parliament and the European Commission, must design this policy together, with maximum transparency.I welcome the creation, by Parliament’s Committee on Regional Development, of a working group on the future of cohesion policy. Consultation on the post-2013 budget and the future objectives of this policy must involve all the actors concerned: the Member States, the regions, the European Commission and Parliament. It is inconceivable to weaken, or indeed abolish, the regional and local levels that give full meaning to this policy. Where financing in particular is concerned, we are today faced with great uncertainty regarding the future of this cohesion policy. The expiry date of the current financial framework is uncertain, as is the extent of the reform of the financial perspective. The importance of maintaining stability in the financing of this policy must be remembered. It is also crucial to reject any idea of renationalising cohesion policy, since this would deprive the regions of the choice of how to share out the Structural Funds and would destroy the regional dimension of this policy.We expect an unmistakably proactive attitude from the Commission concerning the preparation of a White Paper on Territorial Cohesion, Commissioner. With regard to the distribution of these funds, we do not want egalitarianism but financial equity, and we want this in conjunction with a form of harmonious development that is based on findings and on situations that vary according to territory. Cohesion policy must not just focus on the most impoverished regions; it must be aimed at all of Europe’s regions, including those overseas.It is vitally important for Parliament to have clearly identified local contact points.

There are, however, issues that cause me some concern, particularly with regard to the needs of the outermost regions.

Given that we are dealing with a horizontal policy which redistributes more than a third of the EU’s budget, the results from achieving the cohesion objectives have a crucial bearing on the continent’s future. Since its inception, the cohesion policy has achieved spectacular successes in the EU15. Unfortunately, more active intervention is required in the Member States which have recently joined and are affected by extreme poverty. In addition, the situation is made even more difficult by new, strong challenges, such as climate change, the declining population or the global economic recession. Consequently, we must deal in the future with the territorial differences in social and economic indicators within a more effective and flexible framework. Strong emphasis must also be focused on the development of the least developed areas, especially small regions falling behind the regional average and struggling with far more severe disadvantages than even other areas surrounding them. With this purpose in mind, it would be worth considering earmarking resources at EU level, aimed specifically at bringing LAU 1 (formerly NUTS 4) planning-statistical regions into line where the decision about the use of these resources can be made by the relevant small regions or their associations. Coordination with the EU’s other policies must also be improved. The barriers between the various funds must be eliminated so that the maximum possible allocation of resources can be achieved.

The cohesion policy after 2013 (debate) ,"  Tomasz Piotr Poręba  (ECR),  in writing. – (PL) I fear the provisions put forward by the Commission – especially those concerning the ending of Objective 2 and abandonment of the regional aspect of cohesion policy in favour of a sectoral approach – may mean a return to the concept of a two-speed Europe and an increase in the distance, in terms of economy and civilisation, between the old and the new Europe. Such a model would be a departure from integration of the entire 27 and from the idea of solidarity enshrined in Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon. That idea, surely, lies at the root of the entire cohesion policy, which is intended to bring about equalisation of opportunities and elimination of differences between regions.The proposal of the Commission concerning increasing the emphasis on research and the development of new technologies should be praised. This is the route which Europe needs. In choosing this, we must not, however, forget those regions and countries where bringing the standard of living up to the EU average is a fundamental matter. Please remember that between the richest and poorest areas of the EU there is a greater than 11 times difference in wealth. Eliminating these differences must continue to be the main principle of EU cohesion policy.A new version of the document is currently being written. I hope that in the new version, the Commission will take account of the words which were said during today’s debate, and of what is being said in various parts of the European Union and at various levels: local governments, governments, associations and non-governmental organisations.

Nonetheless, we hope that next year’s budgetary procedure will allow sufficient time to deal with these matters.', 'I would also like to take this opportunity to thank once again the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, and the three rapporteurs, Mr Surján, Mr Maňka and Mrs Haug, for their constructive attitude throughout the budgetary procedure, which also demonstrates the very good cooperation that we have enjoyed in this work.', 'I would like to finish with a personal reflection. Being President-in-Office of the Council is probably the most distinguished office that I will ever hold. It has been a great honour for me to serve Europe in this way and I would like to express my thanks for this opportunity. Thank you very much indeed.', '(Applause) ']"

It was an exceptionally difficult budget. In addition, I would like to congratulate our fellow Members, and also all of Parliament, because we have made this decision together. It is, truly, a great result. Congratulations to all!(Applause)Now I have to read out some very important points which are related to the extraordinary way in which we adopted the budget. It is very important because we have moved from the Treaty of Nice to the Treaty of Lisbon. It was a very difficult move. We began under the Treaty of Nice, and we are ending under the Treaty of Lisbon, and this is why this statement is necessary. You have to listen to this statement.‘The budgetary procedure for 2010 has been exceptional. It started under Article 272 of the EC Treaty, but its last stage was conducted when the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force. On 18 November 2009, Parliament, Council and the Commission therefore agreed to continue the budgetary procedure under the EC Treaty, but also reached an agreement covering the outcome of the budgetary procedure, including Parliament’s vote, which took place in full respect of the Multiannual Financial Framework. The President of the Council has just confirmed the agreement of the Council on the budget we have just voted. This means that Parliament and Council have now reached an agreement on a joint text, respecting the aim and purpose of Article 314. I thus note that the budgetary procedure, that was initiated under Article 272 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and continued under Article 314 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, has been completed in accordance with Article 314 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Multiannual Financial Framework. The budgetary procedure can thus be deemed to be completed and the budget is declared definitively adopted.’This is a very important statement. Next time, there will not be such complications, because the Treaty of Lisbon will be in force.

155, 8. Explanations of vote,"  Artur Zasada  (PPE),  in writing. – (PL) Today, we have adopted a European Union budget for 2010 amounting to almost EUR 123 billion. Every budget is a kind of compromise. Perhaps many of us are conscious of its deficiencies, but it is worth stressing that the average citizen of the EU gains by the document adopted today. Above all, the European Union is strengthening its energy security and is banking on the development of businesses, and particularly of micro-enterprises. I am pleased that EUR 20 million has been reserved for the Baltic Sea Strategy. It is true that the reserve funds will be released only when the European Commission presents written proposals for their use. I do believe, however, that this will happen as quickly as possible.

Every budget is a kind of compromise. Perhaps many of us are conscious of its deficiencies, but it is worth stressing that the average citizen of the EU gains by the document adopted today. Above all, the European Union is strengthening its energy security and is banking on the development of businesses, and particularly of micro-enterprises. I am pleased that EUR 20 million has been reserved for the Baltic Sea Strategy. It is true that the reserve funds will be released only when the European Commission presents written proposals for their use. I do believe, however, that this will happen as quickly as possible.

However, we must be vigilant on this point and guard against any kind of demagogy. For the sake of the effectiveness of European action, restrictions must be placed on this sacrosanct principle of transparency.

Without it, these debates will take place in informal settings far removed from official meetings, and the end result will be the opposite of what we were trying to achieve.

This is an unacceptable crime, which must not go unpunished and which the European Union must take a stand against. We must ensure that those within the Congolese army who are responsible for these human rights violations are actually brought to justice. ']"

Breaches of international obligations, the Cotonou agreement and breaches of human rights – as we have always shown – have everything to do with us.This bill’s provisions are draconian and among them, let me inform the House, are: any person alleged to be homosexual would be at risk of life imprisonment or in some circumstances the death penalty; any parent who does not denounce their lesbian daughter or gay son to the authorities would face fines and probably three years in prison; any teacher who does not report a lesbian or gay pupil to the authorities within 24 hours would face the same penalties; any landlord or landlady who happens to give housing to a ‘suspected’ homosexual would risk seven years of imprisonment.Similarly, the bill threatens to punish or ruin the reputation of anyone who works with a gay or lesbian population, such as medical doctors working on AIDS and HIV, civil society leaders active in the fields of sexual and reproductive health, hence, further undermining public health efforts to counter the spread of HIV.It is vital that this afternoon in this House we put aside our prejudices and we defend those who have no one left to defend them.

Why should Uganda’s parliamentarians choose to throw all that goodwill away? Why should they seek to place their country alongside brutal Iran, which regularly executes homosexuals in public?', 'Let us hope that, through our mutual outrage – in this House and in many other parliaments throughout the world – at this piece of brutal legislation, we can convince the Ugandan President to veto it.

202, 12.1. Uganda: anti-homosexual draft legislation,"  Ulrike Lunacek,  author. – (DE) Mr President, some of the previous speakers have given details of this legislation which is now before the Ugandan Parliament. I would like to tell you a brief story. Around four to five years ago, I was in Kampala and one evening I met a group of lesbians, gay men and transgender people in a pizza restaurant, where the owner allowed the meeting to take place. On the same evening, a government minister said that raids would, in future, take place on any places where lesbians, gay men and transgender people met. I was rather worried that evening, as were the Ugandan lesbians and gay men. Luckily nothing happened, but it marked the beginning of increasing homophobia in Uganda. Now proposed legislation has been introduced which will not only make homosexuality a crime, as is already the case, but will also make it subject to the death penalty.So many African Heads of State, including Museveni, have done a lot for their countries, but to say on this basis that homosexuality is un-African is simply wrong. Homosexuality has existed in all cultures on all continents throughout all periods of history and it will continue to exist, regardless of what legislation is passed. I am pleased that we have succeeded in introducing a joint resolution supported by almost all the groups, because it is important to express our opposition to the legislation and to support lesbians, gay men and transgender people in Uganda. We must not allow them to be subjected to hate laws and stand by and say nothing.We in the European Union have an obligation to uphold human rights all over the world and to remind the members of the Ugandan Parliament that the Cotonou Agreement, for example, states that human dignity and human rights apply to everyone and must be defended by everyone. I also hope that the resolution that we have presented will be adopted in its entirety, because it is important for organisations which defend the rights of lesbians, gay men and transgender people in Uganda to be supported, including by the European Union.

For years, NGOs have been sounding the alarm about the violence committed against these groups. The fact is, if the new law is adopted in January 2010, it will exacerbate the situation and make homosexual acts punishable by life imprisonment or by the death penalty for homosexuals who are HIV positive.This law would also be a major obstacle to the fight against AIDS. There are other laws against homosexuals in Africa. However, this one is exceptional because, as Mr Cashman was saying, it forces citizens to report homosexual acts within 24 hours. If you are the doctor, parent or teacher of a homosexual, you have to report him or her to the police, or face a prison term.Furthermore, this bill criminalises the legitimate work of non-governmental organisations, international donors and humanitarian associations which strive to defend and promote human rights in Uganda.As soon as it was presented to the government in Kampala, this bill was strongly condemned by human rights defenders throughout the world, by several states, including France, the United States …(The President interrupted the speaker)and by the European Commissioner for Development, Mr De Gucht.

Today, we need to add the new text to those already adopted. The only attempt by a Ugandan MP to table the anti-homosexuality bill deserves a political response.This proposed law includes provisions to punish those alleged to be lesbian, gay or bisexual with life imprisonment and even the death penalty. The draft also includes a provision that could lead to the imprisonment for up to three years of anyone, including heterosexual people, who fail to report within 24 hours the identities of everyone they know who is lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, or who supports human rights for people who are. That means that any of us would also be susceptible to be taken to court for these reasons as well.We have to remind the European Union and the international organisation that sexual orientation is a matter falling within the remit of the individual right to privacy guaranteed by international human rights law, according to which equality and non-discrimination should be promoted, whilst freedom of expression should be guaranteed. We ask international donors, both governmental and non-governmental, to cease their activities in certain fields should the bill pass.I strongly reject any move to introduce the use of the death penalty.

The bill, if adopted, raises serious human rights issues which are of great importance to the Commission.The Commission considers that the penalisation of homosexuality, as foreseen in the bill, would go against the UN human rights conventions. Uganda has ratified these conventions. Thereby it has the legal obligation to respect them, without distinction or discrimination. Domestic legislation must be consistent with international human rights obligations. The bill would also go against the EU-supported UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity of 18 December 2008 regarding the decriminalisation of homosexuality.Commissioner De Gucht personally raised these concerns in a letter to President Museveni last November. He emphasised that respect for human rights is of the greatest importance to the Commission and to the European Parliament.

216, 12.2. Azerbaijan: freedom of expression,"  Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg,  author. – (PL) When, on 11 November this year, Europe marked the anniversary of the end of the First World War, in Azerbaijan, a sentence of several years’ imprisonment was passed on some journalists who had dared to write about the country’s widespread corruption and unemployment. The journalists were officially charged with spreading hooliganism and terrorism.In the ranking produced by Freedom House, Azerbaijan has the status of ‘Not Free’. Reporters Without Borders say Azerbaijan is in 146th place out of 175 countries surveyed in terms of freedom of speech. Disturbing signals are also coming from analyses conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which has evaluated Azerbaijan on the question of political freedoms. In this context, last year’s refusal by the authorities in Azerbaijan to grant concessions to foreign media, such as the BBC and Radio Free Europe, should not surprise anyone.I think the time has come for the European Union to review its approach to Azerbaijan and, taking advantage of the participation of Baku in the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Policy, to begin to exert greater pressure on the authorities there.

The journalists were officially charged with spreading hooliganism and terrorism.', 'In the ranking produced by Freedom House, Azerbaijan has the status of ‘Not Free’.

In this context, last year’s refusal by the authorities in Azerbaijan to grant concessions to foreign media, such as the BBC and Radio Free Europe, should not surprise anyone.', 'I think the time has come for the European Union to review its approach to Azerbaijan and, taking advantage of the participation of Baku in the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Policy, to begin to exert greater pressure on the authorities there.

217, 12.2. Azerbaijan: freedom of expression,"  Marietje Schaake,  author. – Mr President, Azerbaijan is signatory to a number of partnerships with the EU. It is active in the neighbourhood policy as well as in the Eastern Partnership. This does not only relate to trade. Azerbaijan has also signed up to respect democracy, human rights and the rule of law. However, currently, these are all under serious threat with the present regime.Today we highlight the case of Emin Milli and Adnan Hajizade, which represents a crackdown on free media, free expression and civil society that is much deeper and wider than the case of merely two bloggers, as they have been called. They did indeed use new media like Facebook and Twitter for their youth organisation’s work, but the fact is that we do not even know why they are imprisoned as evidence to defend their case has not been admitted in the trial, and the trial did not meet international standards – and, indeed, looks fabricated.If we cannot rely on the Azerbaijani Government to stay true to its commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of the law through the various agreements it has itself signed with the EU, then Europe cannot consider Azerbaijan to be a credible partner at all; this is also true of trade relations.This resolution urges the Azerbaijani Government to adhere to its own promises and to start building its legitimacy in the international community by respecting its own citizens, granting them democratic and human rights and allowing for respect of the rule of law.Yesterday, we awarded the Sakharov Prize in this House of the European people, and we saw a very impressive speech by the laureate, Mr Kovalev, who said that fear can only be met by freedom of thought, and freedom of thought can only be expressed when freedom of expression is actually guaranteed and when we listen to those people who are simply addressing issues such as opposition to their government, which we, as Europeans, have to guarantee in partnership with Azerbaijan in all areas.

The resolution was prompted among other things by an incident in July 2009 in which two young bloggers, Emin Milli and Adnan Hajizade, were attacked in a restaurant, went to the police to report the incident and were then arrested themselves.They were prosecuted and, according to all the international observers, including Amnesty International, the court proceedings were far from fair. For example, the video which was apparently taken in the restaurant, which clearly showed who had been attacked and that the attackers were other people and not these two bloggers, was not played.It is therefore clear that the judgment does not meet the criteria required by a state under the rule of law. I very much hope that all the evidence will have to be presented in the second trial when it takes place.I am pleased that we have succeeded in introducing a resolution which is supported by almost all the groups.

But we must ask why the regime of Mr Aliyev is implementing such horrific repression. The reason of course is to try and cover up the regime of enormous corruption which exists in that country. The ruling elite has enriched itself fabulously, especially in the oil and gas industry, while 90% of the population of Azerbaijan live in acute poverty and have seen no benefit from the natural resources of their country.Western governments and multinational corporations act, as usual, with great hypocrisy in this regard. They routinely deal with the regime to facilitate doing business, and the corporations make massive profits from the exploitation of the natural resources properly belonging to the people of Azerbaijan. Western governments should be asked why they do not demand that the oil-well be used to transform the lives of the people, instead of propping up this regime.Members of the European Parliament, quite correctly, are harsh in their condemnation of the crushing of the right to dissent and to demonstrate freely in Azerbaijan, and I cannot let this opportunity pass to also condemn the disgraceful repression of protests by the Danish police in Copenhagen in recent days, who arrested up to 1 000 entirely peaceful protestors, handcuffed them and left them lying for hours in the cold.When I protested and demanded the release of some CWI colleagues, the police themselves told me that it was preventive arrest, preventive detention.

In one of the documents, there is a point about the violation of the principles of freedom of speech, and about how journalists and publishers end up in prison, often on fabricated charges, and that they are not given medical help when they are ill. We have a case of a journalist who died because he did not receive medical assistance.', 'I had the opportunity to visit Azeri prisons. The standards which are found there are far different from those to which we are accustomed in Europe. It is good, therefore, that we keep on saying that in Azerbaijan, the principles enshrined in the constitution should be respected. ']"
229, 12.2. Azerbaijan: freedom of expression,"  Paweł Samecki,  Member of the Commission. – Mr President, Azerbaijan is important to the European Union as an energy producer and transit country, and also as a contributor to regional stability in the Southern Caucasus. Azerbaijan is one of the six partner countries under the Eastern Partnership, and we attach great importance to respect for the common values underpinning this relationship.A partnership and cooperation agreement has been in place for 10 years. However, Azerbaijan has expressed its interest in building closer relations with the European Union by concluding an association agreement to replace it.Following the decision of the EU Foreign Affairs Ministers in September to start preparations for concluding such agreements with the Southern Caucasus countries, discussions on the negotiation directives, including for Azerbaijan, are now ongoing.In line with the Council’s decision, the start of negotiations for all the Southern Caucasus countries will be conditional on sufficient progress in meeting the necessary political conditions, namely the rule of law and respect for human rights, the principles of the market economy, as well as sustainable development and good governance.Each year, we draw an in-depth and balanced assessment setting out progress made by each partner country to implement their action plans under the European Neighbourhood Policy. We have just started the preparatory work for the 2009 report.I do not want to pre-empt our report but would like to make a few remarks, particularly on the situation regarding fundamental freedoms and human rights. In our 2008 report, we stated that ‘Azerbaijan has made good progress in economic development, but continues to show a poor record of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law’.Since then, we have unfortunately seen some negative developments, including changes to the Constitution, the abolition of limits on the mandate of the Head of State, as well as the detention and subsequent condemnation of two bloggers.Negative developments also include the continued persecution of human rights defenders, opposition activists and journalists, in addition to further deterioration of media freedom.The European Union has, in its various contacts, taken up these issues at all levels with the authorities and will continue to do so. At the same time, the Commission is mobilising a wide range of tools to assist Azerbaijan to meet the challenges of a new agreement.We are using assistance under the ENPI instrument. We provide targeted support under the comprehensive institution-building programme. This will have important elements related to the rule of law and independence of the judiciary.Azerbaijan will also benefit from assistance under the European initiative for democracy and human rights.Lastly, under the existing partnership and cooperation agreement, we are proposing to set up a subcommittee dedicated to justice, freedom and security, and human rights and democracy. This will constitute an important and additional forum for communicating our messages.
