We are talking about the European Community’s biggest budget and the most visible part as far as the citizens are concerned. The cohesion policy has given Europe a face that shows its interconnectedness and solidarity. No other part of the world has generated so much mutual cohesion. Cohesion is once again also a central objective of the new Treaty of Lisbon. It also adds a third component, namely that of territorial cohesion.Unusual times call for new answers. The financial crisis, tougher competition as a result of globalisation, the climate crisis and the failure, as yet, to achieve the Lisbon objectives demand a more integrated approach, together with a strengthening of, and an improvement drive in, regional policy. We deal with these matters in this Green Paper. This Green Paper is in no way business as usual, but a call for better governance and territorial cohesion that also criticises developments where some regions fly high and there is progress in big-city areas, while other regions are left behind. That is not the Europe that this Parliament expects. In this joint debate today we are therefore also setting the course for the post-2013 period, after the review of the legislation with which we will be beginning the next parliamentary term, after the elections.I will briefly go over the most important points in this debate and in territorial cohesion. Back in 2005, Mr Guellec set out Parliament’s wishes in his report. The new territorial dimension is now set as a permanent objective under Articles 13 and 174 of the new Treaty of Lisbon. As I say, it is an express opposition to an asymmetric Europe made up of some regions expanding at full throttle while more rural areas get left behind. It is the simultaneous unity and diversity of centres of excellence or pôles d'excellence and the specific position of other regions and places with their own qualities and multiformity. Territorial cohesion also complements the existing policy of economic and social cohesion. It is an integrated concept. It provides an insight into the effects of sector-based Community and decentralised activity such as research and development, the common agricultural policy, traffic and transport, the job situation and countering climate change.The concept of territorial cohesion, the consultation of the past six months would seem to suggest, has been broadly subscribed to, and that is to be welcomed. The concept incorporates concentration and at the same time connectivity and cooperation, and it is a concept that we would like to elaborate on over the upcoming period.

It is an expression of solidarity. However, cohesion policy is not only needed by those in our society who are supposedly weaker. All our citizens need a policy of solidarity and European integration. This makes things all the more difficult when no use is made of Structural Funds in the regions, of which we have more than 260 in the European Union. This is not because no help is needed, but because the obstacles to obtaining the funds are too hard to overcome. Some of these obstacles are home-made. Of course, it is an important basic requirement that the rules are observed and that controls are put in place to ensure that the money provided by European taxpayers is used correctly. However, this must not result in the application forms and the explanations of how the funding can be obtained being so lengthy and incomprehensible that you need a PhD to understand them.Therefore, I call in my report for specific measures to reduce the amount of bureaucracy at European level, because we are responsible for this. For example, the system of controls should be simplified, the administrative burden on the projects should be reduced and the size of the projects should be modified. In addition, the project practices should be simplified, clarified and accelerated and made more result-oriented. However, I am convinced that something could also be done in this respect at national and regional level.The second part of my report concerns best practices in cohesion policy. We must not reinvent the wheel, because this would be neither efficient nor clever. Therefore, we need to find a system for making good examples of projects available for use by others. As there are tens of thousands of cohesion policy projects every year, the trick is to identify, select and provide information about exemplary projects in the regions. In my opinion, the Commission has already made a good start in this area, for example with the RegioStars initiative, but this needs further development.In some of what I believe are key areas, the report proposes criteria for selecting these projects. The key areas include research and innovation, creating high-quality jobs, support for SMEs, climate projects, integrated urban development and the development of private-public partnership projects, to name but a few. For example, the criteria for selecting best-practice projects could be the quality and sustainability of the projects, the driving force for the regions and for the European Union, the effective use of resources and, of course, transferability to other regions.There are good examples to be found everywhere. In the appendix to the report I have listed some projects which I have been informed about as a result of the groundwork done in the regions. They come from all the Member States. I would like to mention a few of them here: a centre of excellence for environmental technologies in Slovenia, the Burgenland Mobility Centre in Austria, the ‘brain hunt’ competition in Estonia, the new building for the Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology in Germany, the science park in Granada in Spain and the development of the problem district of East Leipzig in Germany.Finally, as rapporteur and coordinator of my group, I would like to extend my very warm thanks to my colleagues for their cooperation, not only on this report but also over the last five years. I would also like to thank the Commission, the Committee on Regional Development and all the relevant employees for their cooperation. I hope that we can continue to work together in this way in future.(Applause) ","Constanze Angela Krehl,",7,619,not_available,"['ger', 'ger', 'ger', 'ger', 'ger', 'ger', 'ger']","['  Constanze Angela Krehl,  rapporteur. – (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cohesion policy is important for Europe.

It is a report which examines options and the involvement of cities in the management and use of European money in the current programming period. It is a report which at the same time provides guidance and offers inspiration on how to adapt the Structural Funds rules so that they better suit the needs of European cities and metropolises. In drafting the report I have relied not only on scientific studies and expert opinions from interest groups such as the European Council of Municipalities and Regions and EUROCITIES, but above all on the direct experience and opinions of mayors, councillors, town hall officials, project managers and everyone else concerned with European funds. One of the inspiring meetings providing us with an opportunity for joint discussions on the urban dimension was an event entitled European Urban Day, which I organised together with partners at the beginning of February in Prague within the framework of the Czech Presidency of the EU. I would like at this point once again to thank Commissioner Hübner, Mr Svoboda and my colleagues Mr Olbrycht, Mr Beaupuy and Mrs Kallenbach for their participation and their active approach.It is logical that our attention is focused on cities. Cities are home to 80% of the 500 million or so inhabitants of the EU. It is in cities that the great majority of jobs, companies and centres of education are located. Cities generate more than 70% of Europe’s VAT. Cities therefore constitute a definite driving force for the economic growth of the whole of Europe, which makes them all the more important in a time of crisis. However, many cities are facing a range of serious problems. Cities and urban areas therefore need special attention within the framework of the cohesion policy.I would like to emphasise two main ideas from the text of the report. The first is the question of sub-delegation, which means transferring control of European resources to cities. Although European legislation already permits the sub-delegation of resources to cities so that they can allocate them when creating integrated development plans, Member States have made only marginal use of this option. One of the main aims of this report is to support the role of cities in the cohesion process. We must stop regarding cities merely as final recipients and instead view them as entities that administer territories. Just as regions and national civil service bodies hold their own budgets, cities must gain greater responsibility in the area of structural assistance for programming and distributing Structural Funds. The urban dimension must become mandatory.The second fundamental idea is to really exploit the potential of the financial instrument JESSICA. Cohesion policy has hitherto been based exclusively on a system of subsidies, or in other words, non-returnable grants. The organisations and individuals submitting projects are therefore used to a situation where they receive European money and national budget resources earmarked for cofinancing ‘free of charge’. The priority is often drawdown itself rather than an effective investment or an evaluation of available resources. Therefore the subsidy principle sometimes leads to a situation where some of the structural assistance is not used efficiently. In the current programming period we have seen JESSICA implemented to create space for a systematic amendment of the cohesion policy. However, the fact is that not much use has been made of the space. This must change in the next programming period. European policy should make more use of options relating to the use of financial engineering funds such as revolving funds. That is all for now. I would like to thank everyone who assisted me in drafting this report.

One important change was the creation of a new European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development linked to the common agricultural policy. Whereas the 2000-2006 Financial Perspective tied rural development funding in with the Structural Funds and cohesion policy, separating it from CAP funding, under the new 2007-2013 Financial Framework they became part of the allocations linked to the CAP. As a consequence of these changes, however, the question arises as to whether this separation has actually led to more effective use of the available funding.Linking the CAP and rural development funding represents a simplification of the budgetary arrangements in appearance only. In reality, it means the separation of non-agricultural funding from the scope of the cohesion policy and as a result, either the duplication of some objectives, or their omission in both areas. There is a risk that the funding available under the regional policy will be used to a large extent to boost economic competitiveness in larger urban centres or the most dynamic regions, while the rural development fund will be focused on non-agricultural improvement, on improving agricultural competitiveness. In this situation, spending on support for non-agricultural activities and the development of SMEs in rural areas would be at the interface between the two funds and not be covered by either of them.There could also be a shortage of funding to ensure basic public services and investment in infrastructure in rural areas, to which the Cohesion Fund is also meant to contribute. In this context it is becoming particularly important to come up with a transparent, long-term development strategy for rural areas at Member State and at regional level, in order to identify clearly rural development priorities and objectives and adapt to them the various sources of funding available. Linking the second pillar to cohesion policy measures would, however, require the close coordination of activities at national level.What constitutes a rural area has yet to be defined with any precision. Traditionally, rural areas could be differentiated from urban areas through their lower population density, different employment structure, lower level of income and poorer access to public roads. From the point of view of territorial cohesion, which, I repeat, has also not been adequately defined, lower population density should not be the decisive characteristic.One of the European Union’s development aims is to modernise social structures, including employment structures. It is possible to increase territorial cohesion, therefore, by aligning rural and urban employment structures. Level of income and access to public goods, however, remain the biggest challenge to territorial cohesion, and these objectives can be most effectively met by supporting non-agricultural activities in rural areas. Rural development should not, however, drain resources intended for direct payments to farmers.The difficulty in implementing rural development policy stems from the fact that sectoral policies and territorial cohesion policies overlap, as do the economic and social dimensions, and therefore previous activities have focused on a separation of powers, rather than creating synergies. The aim of coordination should, however, be to create synergies in the use of funds. In the individual Member States, several models exist for the coordination of these activities, and it is currently difficult to claim that a particular country’s solution should serve as a model for others. It does appear, though, that political will could be more decisive in terms of ensuring success than this or that organisational arrangement. A suitable solution could therefore be to apply the open method of coordination to this aspect of cooperation at Union level.However, it should be made clear that rural development policy has a huge impact on territorial cohesion. For this reason, it does not seem justifiable to separate measures under this policy from cohesion and regional development policy. This policy is better able than the CAP to assist with non-agricultural aspects of rural development, such as retraining people for work in other areas of the economy. Nevertheless, including rural development policy within cohesion policy is only possible on the condition that rural development receives adequate funding.

I would especially like to thank those who worked with me on the report, especially our EPP-ED adviser, Ms Stoian, and our committee administrator, Mr Chopin, who both devoted long hours to this report.Let me briefly recapitulate on the making of this report, which obtained, with just a few compromises, the full support of the Committee on Regional Development just last month. As you may already know, the aim of this report is to show the way in which the Member States understood and follow the 2006 Community strategic guidelines on cohesion when drawing up their 27 national strategic reference frameworks and 429 operational programmes adapted to meet their specific constraints and requirements.I have therefore decided to base this report on three main documents: firstly, the communication from the Commission; secondly, the 27 country fiches provided by the Commission and, thirdly, the Council decision of 2006 on Community strategic guidelines on cohesion, which represents an indicative framework for the Member States for the preparation of the national strategic reference frameworks and the operational programmes for the period 2007-2013.The three leading priorities that were clearly set by the aforementioned Council decision are: firstly, making Europe and its regions more attractive places in which to invest and work; the second priority is to improve knowledge and innovation for growth; and the third priority is to attract more people into employment or entrepreneurial activity in order to create more and better jobs.Before I share what I have observed while working on this report, it is important to underline that its scope is partly limited by the fact that the operational programmes were only approved in June 2008 and it will take at least a year before any real advances in their implementation can be assessed. Nevertheless, I can already assess that the general priorities have been adhered to by all Member States, with specific particularities imposed by their level of economic and territorial development.It is also important to note that they might suffer certain changes in the sense of the increasing focus on investments in areas with immediate growth potential and urgency in the context of the European economic recovery plan, the Community response to the global financial crisis, and the current economic slowdown. In other words, it is important to remember that each Member State, and even more so the regions, have diverse needs arising from their geographical location and economic and institutional development. Therefore, the resulting tailor-made national cohesion strategies in the operational programme undoubtedly vary significantly according to these needs.It is known that Member States were required by the general regulations of the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund to earmark 60% of the total expenditure for the cohesion objective and 75% for the regional competitiveness and employment objective. However, I am pleased to see that the efforts made by the national authorities have ensured that the average allocation of expenditure for achievement of the Lisbon Agenda constitutes 65% – more than the available funds in the convergence regions – and 82% in the regional competitiveness and employment regions, which is also more than initially requested.I see my time is up. I had much more prepared. I will finish at the end of this debate.

I wish to express my gratitude that the Commission addressed the topic of micro-credit in a separate report back in November 2007, although it is also true that Parliament had already requested that summer that we work on this subject. I also approve of the fact that this debate is being coordinated by the member of the Commission responsible for cohesion, for as we know, previously it was mooted that the Commissioner for financial affairs should coordinate it; but the goal is that Community tools should truly reflect the perspectives of cohesion.I regret, however, that the Commission’s materials did not extend to legislative tasks or include legislative proposals; therefore, the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs invoked the strongest possible measure, namely Article 39, and asked that concrete legal measures or organisational and financial steps be taken by the Commission in five different areas.I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to my shadow rapporteur, Mrs De Vits, to my colleague, Mrs Baeva, and to Mrs Ambruster of the Secretariat, for their enthusiastic work.Why is micro-credit important? On the one hand, we would like to include in the national Lisbon action programmes the obligation of Member States to report regularly on their progress in this area. Only that which is obligatory yields results.On the other hand, and this is the greatest merit of the Commissioner’s approach, we wish to include new social segments in the sphere of economic activities. To this end, we need to launch a form of credit that helps persons with modest skills, who lack the collateral or real estate coverage required for traditional small business credit, to enter the labour market. Involving these new segments in the labour market will be indispensable for sustainable development and for attaining the 70% legal employment rate.But how should we approach these layers of society? On the one hand, as my report also mentions, we need to move beyond the tendency to look at those in difficulty as a single group. We need to define disadvantaged groups more precisely: these include migrants in western countries, Roma in eastern areas, people living in rural areas or encampments and, generally speaking, women.Yet these people cannot be reached in the tried and true manner, directly through the traditional networks of commercial banks, because these target groups are suspicious of the above instruments, and as already mentioned, they are not able to enter the free market. Therefore, inspired by the Asian example transposed to Europe, loans need to be made in small circles, having gained their confidence, basing the credit more on trust than on collateral. The intermediary organisation plays an important role in this system, of course, and this organisation must be able to carry on these activities even if it does not have a banking licence. We have succeeded in achieving this in certain Member States, but it is not yet the case everywhere, and therefore we need to involve non-bank organisations, including financial institutions that are close to the population and outside the securitisation market.The question of an interest-rate cap has come up, and it is our opinion that although credit is expensive, the most important consideration is nonetheless a steady stream of liquidity for those using the system. For this reason I do not support introducing an interest-rate cap. Here we need to distinguish between consumer credit and micro-credit, for the two should not be confused.It is important, moreover, to create incentives at national level, so that people should want to become micro-entrepreneurs with the help of micro-credit rather than collecting unemployment benefit. We need to show solidarity in the struggle against terrorism and the fight against money-laundering as well, for it is precisely by means of a mentorship system that we can somehow overcome the problems of a lack of permanent address or of a bank account, and the lack of start-up capital.

It is a discussion that will certainly contribute to the debate on the future cohesion policy.We are in the middle of that debate, as you know, and there are many very specific recommendations in your reports, which I will take as important inputs into this debate on the future cohesion policy, while there are also several major messages that cut across all the reports.The first is that cohesion policy is, and should remain, a central pillar for achieving the European Union’s sustainable development goals. That commitment will remain even more relevant in the post-crisis period, when generating green-collar jobs will be the European pass to sustainable employment.There is also another clear message in all the reports, which is that cohesion policy should cover all the European territory, while the focus of cohesion policy should clearly remain on supporting the catch-up process of the poorest. I share your view on the importance of delivering European public goods in all regions. The crisis makes that message even more relevant. Many regions are looking these days at new ways and means of adapting to rapid global changes and avoiding the risk of falling behind. By mobilising under-utilised resources and exploiting comparative advantages, cohesion policy aims to ensure that all European regions, be they lagging behind or not, contribute to overall economic growth and change and to the creation of sustainable jobs, and that all citizens can benefit from the internal market.We also share the conviction that geography matters in Europe, and this is one of the main reasons we launched the green paper on territorial cohesion. I am very pleased to see that you understand territorial cohesion in a way that is close to my heart, which is that territorial cohesion is first of all about mobilising the development potential of all the different territories. Regional policy is a development policy that helps citizens and enterprises unlock the inherent potentials of the places in which they live and work.I agree with you on the need to improve synergies and coordination between all European and national policies with a territorial impact. Here, the challenge is for territorial cohesion to be taken into account upfront when designing policies, and not to be seen as a tool to repair the damage once it has been done. This means, among other things, that we need to invest more in linking the regions that are lagging behind with the more prosperous ones.Your message is also clear on the need to strengthen the urban-rural relationship. Faced with the present fragmentation of funds, it also means that we need to understand better how to streamline the rules and procedures for all the funds with respect to eligible expenditure, management, monitoring, reporting and financial management obligations.There is a need for greater flexibility when delineating the territories in which cohesion policy programmes are designed and implemented. In other words, we need to target the policy at functional areas. We need, for example, to look sometimes inside cities at neighbourhood level, and sometimes beyond the boundaries of the cities, at metropolitan level.This functional or flexible geography does not stop at national borders, and cooperation across national borders is of clear European added value and importance for citizens. There are still barriers in the European internal market, and significant untapped potential in cross-border labour markets and transnational clusters. The Baltic Sea Strategy, which we are preparing now, is a good example of what we mean by a functional area. I see this as a test case for territorial cohesion, which could then be extended to other macro-regions. We are working on this.All the reports underline the need for cohesion policy to respond to new challenges such as demography, energy, climate and globalisation. All European regions will be affected by those new challenges, but their impact will vary significantly across Europe, often resulting in losses of competitiveness, employment and social cohesion. This might consolidate existing disparities and create new ones, but these challenges can also be turned into opportunities. To achieve this we need to continue emphasising cohesion policy investment in research and development, and innovation in developing a knowledge-based economy and in promoting entrepreneurship and business support services. These are key factors for boosting the sustainable competitiveness of the European economy and for generating sustainable jobs and growth. They are at the heart of cohesion policy and have a strong territorial dimension, which requires tailor-made solutions and policy support.To render the management of cohesion policy programmes more efficient – and this is our common concern – there is a need to reinforce inter-regional exchanges of experience and of good practice. Good governance practice must be disseminated rapidly across Europe. This may help also to overcome difficulties in implementing cohesion programmes. I share your view that we must continue to reform policy delivery.You call for fostering the effort devoted to so-called ‘financial engineering’ as a means of tapping the potential of the private sector. As you well know, in an important cultural shift, we have decided to complement a traditional ground-based approach with new tools.Your support for our micro-credit initiative is good news, and I thank you very much for this. I am convinced that developing micro-credit schemes is crucial for the sustainable development and competitiveness of European regions and cities. It requires action to be taken at all levels. We will look into ways and means of reinforcing this instrument in the future.You call also for a strengthening of the fundamental principles of cohesion policy, such as partnership, multi-level governance and transparency, and I fully endorse that call. By building on local knowledge, by involving all the relevant actors on the ground and by improving the visibility of the European cohesion policy, we will certainly enhance the impact and the quality of European cohesion investment.Once again, my thanks for your continuous efforts to render cohesion policy more effective and more efficient in the future.

My colleagues from the ALDE Group will deal with the other items.Mr van Nistelrooij’s report responds to the Green Paper on territorial cohesion published by the Commission. We all agree that the debate started on the future cohesion policy should be supplemented by the territorial dimension. However, we have a paradox: we are discussing territorial cohesion without defining what it means.We want the territorial dimension to help achieve a more balanced development than it has done to date, so that all citizens of the European Union have the opportunity of equal access to services in particular. However, to date we lack a precise set of criteria to which we can refer. Yet this is of fundamental significance for the future. The discussion on territorial cohesion in the European Union no longer makes any sense if we do not draft a cohesive definition.Achieving territorial cohesion means ensuring the best possible development for the entire territory of the Community, and improving the lives of its inhabitants. As stated in the report, the aim of territorial cohesion should be above all to even out the disparities in the level of development of individual regions and Member States, and in particular to eliminate the growing disparities within regions and countries.The more the gap between individual states is reduced, the greater the internal differentiation. Most investments and funding are accumulated in the national and regional capitals at the expense of the other territories, and Member States cannot or do not wish to counteract this. In this situation, it is necessary to create mechanisms at Community level that will effectively stimulate a more even and sustainable development.In my view, we should scrutinise the statistical data for NUTS3, and not just NUTS2. The NUTS3 data show up the problem far more clearly. We should take this into account when allocating funding. The process of achieving territorial cohesion must be carried out at all levels: European, national and regional, taking into account the principle of subsidiarity.Exchanging good practice is particularly important. The effectiveness of cohesion policy depends to a great extent on simplifying procedures, and in particular on becoming familiar with the opportunities provided by the most effective solutions used elsewhere.

Rural development cannot be implemented through sudden ad hoc decisions, but must be based on a long-term plan. However, we are lacking such a plan. Reinstatement of the rural development budget is thus also becoming a key condition for the entire cohesion policy. ']"

I would like to congratulate each of our fellow Members for their efforts and for the proposals which they have made.I am going to make a few comments about some of the topics, starting with territorial cohesion. The basic problem is how to guarantee the harmonious development of all the territories in the European Union and the partnership between urban and rural areas in order to stop losing territory and respond to the depopulation of rural areas. Without a definition of territorial cohesion, which Parliament is waiting for, the integrated concept of economic, social and territorial cohesion provides the future basis for EU regional policy and for the Structural Funds’ format after 2009.As regards the Krehl report, I support all the proposals in this report which support Europe’s regions and mention removing obstacles and simplifying procedures, as well as their stability over time, along with the proposal to devise rigorous methods for exchanging good practice between regions.As far as the cohesion policy’s urban dimension is concerned, we know that we do not have a common definition for ‘urban’. We also know that we have roughly 5 000 towns in Europe with fewer than 50 000 inhabitants. Romania has a considerable number of such populated settlements. I believe that we need a development model and sufficient resources for urban settlements of this kind because these are precisely areas which are lacking or missing out on the beneficial impact of the polycentric approach.As part of territorial cohesion, integrated, sustainable urban development will be, according to the new Treaty, managed jointly by Member States and the EU.

The basic problem is how to guarantee the harmonious development of all the territories in the European Union and the partnership between urban and rural areas in order to stop losing territory and respond to the depopulation of rural areas. Without a definition of territorial cohesion, which Parliament is waiting for, the integrated concept of economic, social and territorial cohesion provides the future basis for EU regional policy and for the Structural Funds’ format after 2009.', 'As regards the Krehl report, I support all the proposals in this report which support Europe’s regions and mention removing obstacles and simplifying procedures, as well as their stability over time, along with the proposal to devise rigorous methods for exchanging good practice between regions.', 'As far as the cohesion policy’s urban dimension is concerned, we know that we do not have a common definition for ‘urban’. We also know that we have roughly 5 000 towns in Europe with fewer than 50 000 inhabitants. Romania has a considerable number of such populated settlements. I believe that we need a development model and sufficient resources for urban settlements of this kind because these are precisely areas which are lacking or missing out on the beneficial impact of the polycentric approach.', 'As part of territorial cohesion, integrated, sustainable urban development will be, according to the new Treaty, managed jointly by Member States and the EU.

Whilst I regret that I cannot respond to all the questions, I very much appreciate all the bilateral exchanges we have had over the last years in Brussels or during my visits on the ground in your constituencies. You are welcome to continue this dialogue with us in the Commission. I should like to thank you for this really good and genuine debate today.We need to fully and wisely exploit the potential of all European and national policies to ensure that the European Union as an economy and a society comes out of the crisis stronger economically, socially and politically, with solid foundations for long-term sustainable development. I feel that today’s debate confirms that European cohesion policy must play its role in this process both today and tomorrow. It is our common task today to ensure that the potential of cohesion policy – its capacity to deliver sustainable development and jobs – will be used fully and wisely in this new global context. I am not only thinking of the crisis, but also of all those well-known challenges that we identified years ago as important challenges for European development.Supporting sustainable competitiveness is the most effective way to achieve cohesion in the European Union. In this context, we must use the cohesion policy to target factors such as access by small and medium-sized enterprises to finance. We must also address issues such as better access to public services that aim to improve employability and productivity and thus contribute to more equal opportunities.As some of you have stressed, over the last years it has become common sense that addressing the new challenges clearly requires an integrated and place-based approach – an approach that optimises the use of resources and also mobilises all partners at regional and local level, as well as national and European level, so that we are active at all levels of European governance.Concerning the partnership principle, I would like to stress that this has been a very important objective from day one of my term in office, and the Commission has invested a lot in making the partnership principle and the cohesion policy a real one – one which is really used on the ground. Soon after the negotiations, we conducted a full assessment of how the partnership principle and the process of designing policy programmes were implemented by the Member States and the regions. We did not want just the formal presence of partnership principles, so we also worked with partners, helping them to build their capacity to be real partners in the policy management system, and we react quite efficiently to any signals we get from the ground that this principle is not being respected in the individual Member States. I have just had a meeting on this very issue with NGOs from one of the central European Member States.I also fully agree with all of you who say that cohesion policy does not, and must not, work in isolation; that we need to reinforce the synergies and coordination between the cohesion policy and all other sectoral, national or European policies. This is not just to avoid overlap or duplication, but is also about using the synergy that comes from good coordination between the policies. Certainly, the rural development and regional policies are an extreme example of the need to have very good coordination and the use of synergies between policies.Another example could be competitiveness and the need to take into account the constraints coming from a low-carbon economy and climate change regarding infrastructure investment. I would like to underline very strongly that we have invested a lot in greening the European cohesion policy. We established the objectives relating to climate change, energy efficiency and renewable energy before the major debate exploded on climate change in the European Union. Today we have one third of cohesion policy funding going directly into green investment in all areas of our life. Recently added to the policy is the additional 4% to be used in the area of housing for energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy that allows us to put more emphasis on this challenge.What also clearly emerges from the debate is that we need both continuity and reform in policy delivery. On the continuity side, I would very strongly stress that this multiannual programming, financial additionality, shared management and partnership principles represent a great European value that we should continue to care about. But there is also this need for change to strike a better balance between the demands of financial management and control and the tasks of achieving good results and good implementation of the policy. There is no doubt that we need to put in place a simpler, more efficient and more effective implementing mechanism and reduce administrative complexity and the administrative burden.We have been working with your great support over the last months on this challenge. We already had the first amendment of Article 55 back in December and we will be voting on the main chunk of simplification proposals a week from now. The task force that we set up with Member States for the simplification of the policies is continuing its work, and at the end of May we will have another proposal, hopefully still related to this period.I agree with you that for the policy to be more effective we also need a stronger focus on results, stronger monitoring and an evaluation culture. We are continuing to work on this. I very much appreciate your support for financial engineering. We are on track, but much more can certainly be done. Please also take note with respect to financial engineering, which is today one of the major instruments helping small and medium-sized companies access credit through JEREMIE and now also through JASMINE for micro-credit, that we started this process long before the crisis hit, so the policy has also been relatively well prepared for these difficult times.Some of you mentioned the question of transparency. I would just like to remind all of us here that we have new rules for this new period 2007-2013. We have the obligation to inform the public on all the beneficiaries, so we hope that with these transparency obligations we will also see major change with regard to public awareness and the integrity of the whole process.Very briefly, on culture, because it was raised as an important element, we are fully aware – and I also see it during my travels – that both regions and cities are major actors in the cultural field in Europe. Culture also plays an important economic role in the development of regional development. We have recognised this in the framework of the European cohesion policy. We have many regional and local urban strategies that have successfully integrated culture into our policy.Let me also inform you that the Commission will soon launch an independent study on the contribution of culture to local and regional development, hopefully to be finalised by the beginning of next year. Through this we will have a better-informed basis for the further inclusion of culture in European policies.Finally, I very much appreciate all your comments not just on the report, but also what you have presented here as your concerns and ideas for the future. I shall include most of those messages in my orientation paper which I will present to Council at the end of May. We are also completing the independent study by a group of researchers and experts chaired by Professor Fabrizio Barca. This will be presented publicly at the end of April. The final official assessment of the consultation on the green paper on territorial cohesion will be presented in our sixth interim cohesion report which will be adopted by the Commission towards the end of June.

It is clear that the greatest need is to assess the usefulness of incorporating the URBAN initiative into the mainstream of cohesion policy. We must assess the options and verify levels of satisfaction among mayors, councillors and elected representatives in relation to the drawdown of European funds in urban areas. Integrated planning and the transfer of responsibility or so-called sub-delegation of resources or financial engineering instruments are clearly areas where a more active approach is needed from the Commission, at least through the presentation of recommendations or examples of proven approaches. At the same time, we must continue to simplify cohesion policy in its entirety and not just the urban aspect. Long-term options might include, for example, a merger of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund. Last but not least it is vitally important for the Commission to measure and regularly assess the impact of all policies on urban life and at the same time to discuss the effectiveness of these policies directly with urban authorities. This report therefore recommends that the Commission and the Member States establish an EU High Level Group on Urban Development and apply the open method of coordination to urban development policy at EU level in the same way that it is applied in other areas such as social integration for example. At the same time the report also calls for the position of urban areas in the Regions for Economic Change initiative to be strengthened and for the Urban Audit project to be further developed and regularly updated.

We must therefore welcome all attempts to simplify the achievement of this objective. However, the concept of territorial cohesion has not yet been defined with any precision. The Green Paper is therefore the beginning, rather than the end of the debate on this matter.I am pleased that the Commissioner pointed out the need to reduce the disparities in development levels and the importance of synergies in implementing EU policies. Different regions have quite different problems in terms of income levels, geographical location, migration, etc. However, we need to remember what my Polish fellow Members, Mrs Staniszewska, Mr Podkański and Mr Zapałowski said, about funds tending to accumulate in the centres of the regions. We should also remember that the aims of rural development policy are not necessarily a contradiction of the Lisbon goals if use is made of the relative competitiveness mechanism, or low-cost increases in productivity.The Committee on Agriculture has not commented on my report, so I take their silence to mean agreement.

We must therefore welcome all attempts to simplify the achievement of this objective. However, the concept of territorial cohesion has not yet been defined with any precision. The Green Paper is therefore the beginning, rather than the end of the debate on this matter.', 'I am pleased that the Commissioner pointed out the need to reduce the disparities in development levels and the importance of synergies in implementing EU policies. Different regions have quite different problems in terms of income levels, geographical location, migration, etc. However, we need to remember what my Polish fellow Members, Mrs Staniszewska, Mr Podkański and Mr Zapałowski said, about funds tending to accumulate in the centres of the regions. We should also remember that the aims of rural development policy are not necessarily a contradiction of the Lisbon goals if use is made of the relative competitiveness mechanism, or low-cost increases in productivity.', 'The Committee on Agriculture has not commented on my report, so I take their silence to mean agreement.

At the same time, I would seriously welcome a much higher allocation for energy efficiency and renewable energies – currently EUR 9 million – as well as a higher allocation for measures to combat climate change, which, at EUR 48 billion, is less than required at the moment.I strongly believe that deciding on how we use these funds to protect our regions and combat the consequences of climate change, such as floods and droughts, will determine the future of our regions and their economic positioning. I also greatly appreciate the fact that all Member States have already devoted a significant amount of their total financial allocations to investments in research, development and innovation, but I have also noticed that, for most of the EU convergence regions, ensuring accessibility remains a significant problem as they face a lack of transport infrastructure.On the other hand, I am glad to witness Member States’ efforts to prioritise investments aimed at increasing labour participation and improving skills, as well as fighting against poverty and social exclusion in their programmes financed by the European social funds. Furthermore, I encourage new Member States to continue to build up effective partnerships and to consistently reinforce the partnership principle while implementing the operational programmes. I believe that the new Member States could truly benefit from further exchanges of best practices and knowledge about developments in technologies, for example, and from other common actions to speed up their potential as regards implementation.

The document rightly points out that disadvantaged groups, including the long-term unemployed, welfare dependants, and ethnic minorities such as the Roma, in particular, should be the focus of European initiatives regarding micro-credit.Micro-financing has proven highly successful in numerous countries in promoting social and economic integration by supporting self-employment. At a time of financial crisis, simple financial instruments that are able to fund business, especially in underdeveloped regions or the above-mentioned social groups, are of particular value. Those wishing to run small family businesses can face significant difficulties in tenders administered within the framework of cohesion policy, especially in the case of cofinancing.

The document rightly points out that disadvantaged groups, including the long-term unemployed, welfare dependants, and ethnic minorities such as the Roma, in particular, should be the focus of European initiatives regarding micro-credit.', 'Micro-financing has proven highly successful in numerous countries in promoting social and economic integration by supporting self-employment. At a time of financial crisis, simple financial instruments that are able to fund business, especially in underdeveloped regions or the above-mentioned social groups, are of particular value. Those wishing to run small family businesses can face significant difficulties in tenders administered within the framework of cohesion policy, especially in the case of cofinancing.

In the Financial Perspective 2007-2013, the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development was made the second pillar of the CAP and was thereby separated from cohesion policy. As a result of this development, particularly in view of the slender budget funds available, cohesion policy, particularly that of the European Regional Development Fund, has focused on economic competitiveness concentrated in the larger urban centres or the most active regions, while the EAFRD is concentrating its resources on improving agricultural competitiveness.This approach may result either in the duplication of some objectives, for example environmental protection, education and culture, or their omission in both areas.2. Therefore, we need to assess whether the funding designated for rural development in 2007-2013 should be used more to support farmers, or whether it will be assigned more to non-farming rural beneficiaries, or even beneficiaries who remain in rural areas but will move from the farming sector to other areas of professional activity. If it turns out that support for farmers is the preferred objective of the second pillar, it appears that in the next perspective it would be favourable to tie these funds in to cohesion policy.3. It is also necessary to increase the funding pot for the second pillar of the CAP, albeit, as called for by the European Parliament, through a reduction in direct payments to large farmers, and a gradual increase in modulation rates.

Just yesterday the Spanish newspaper El País reported that the Spanish Supreme Court decided three months ago that a box should be included on pre-enrolment forms asking parents in which language they want their children to receive their education, and also that the Catalan authorities are not complying with this decision.The signatories of the alternative do not want this right to be recognised for parents in countries with more than one official or regional language.They do not want to recognise the vital need for education in the mother tongue, not only for educational success in general but also in particular for the learning of other languages.They do not want to ensure full mutual intelligibility between the languages spoken in a country in this situation, especially in relation to senior citizens and to the legal system, health, administration and employment.They do not accept that, in these countries, one language should not be promoted at the expense of the rights of speakers of another language or other languages.This contradicts everything that this Parliament and the other European institutions have upheld.As a result, paragraphs 11, 12, 14 and 17 of my report are omitted from the alternative. Looking at these paragraphs, such negative positions clearly clash with our fundamental rights and freedoms and patently infringe the principle of subsidiarity.My report does not attack or harm so-called minority languages.

The point about dialogue is that it is not a monologue: you have to listen to what the citizens of Europe say. The citizens of Europe in the Netherlands, in France and in the Republic of Ireland have said very clearly, in relation to the Lisbon Treaty, that they do not want that Treaty.If, therefore, this Parliament and all the European institutions want to have dialogue with their citizens, which is a good idea, let them proclaim without any equivocation that it is dialogue which they will respond to, and that they will listen to what the citizens say. It is an utter waste of time this Parliament even debating or reporting or voting on the idea of dialogue if collectively – and that is the truth about this Parliament – it refuses to acknowledge what is said to it and refuses to respond to it.

I hope the Court of Human Rights takes our statement into consideration when delivering its verdict in this case.Finally, I agree with Mr Corbett that there has been a lot of talk about democracy here today but – for those who take the time and trouble – if one adds up the number of people who have voted on the Constitution and the Lisbon Treaty in all the referenda in Europe, there are in excess of 27 million Europeans who have said ‘yes’ and 24 million who have said ‘no’.

I hope the Court of Human Rights takes our statement into consideration when delivering its verdict in this case.', 'Finally, I agree with Mr Corbett that there has been a lot of talk about democracy here today but – for those who take the time and trouble – if one adds up the number of people who have voted on the Constitution and the Lisbon Treaty in all the referenda in Europe, there are in excess of 27 million Europeans who have said ‘yes’ and 24 million who have said ‘no’.

155, 5. Explanations of vote,"  Marian Harkin  (ALDE). -   Mr President, I am particularly supportive of this report, the mention of credit unions and recognition of their contribution to providing microcredit facilities. As not-for-profit organisations, credit unions play a unique role in providing microcredit to many who would not be offered credit by many of the other financial institutions. I know that credit unions are not strong in all European countries, but they are strong in many, with reserves in excess of EUR 40 billion. Worldwide credit unions have reserves in excess of USD 1.1 trillion, with almost 180 million members worldwide.At a time when many people are losing faith in banking institutions, not-for-profit financial institutions are a viable alternative and they need our support. In particular, they need to be included in the JASMINE programme so that, as providers of microfinance, they have access to business support services such as mentoring, training, advice, financing and education, etc.Finally, a clarification on the Muscardini report: I believe we voted for and passed Amendment 1, where the term ‘sexual and reproductive rights’ was amended to ‘sexual and reproductive health’. In this context, I am not sure I agree with my Irish colleagues who spoke earlier on this matter.

One is Opportunity International, which is headed by a former central bank governor of an African country and brings a professional approach to microcredit where sometimes that has been sadly lacking. The other is an organisation and its excellent website – www.kiva.org – which allows people to lend as little as USD 25 individually and is aggregated up to larger microloans to entrepreneurs across the world, particularly in developing countries, allowing them to create wealth and jobs in their local communities.The one point I would like to make is that we must make sure that local, national or EU government does not crowd out the small community-led and private microcredit providers.

Indeed, it is by taking real action closer to citizens, by simply talking to them about Europe, that they can get a clearer picture of what the European Union does for them in their daily lives.', 'Encouraging this dialogue will be key in the run-up to the June elections, especially in rural areas and among the most Eurosceptic groups, such as young people and women. The recent interinstitutional political declaration signed by Parliament, the Council and the European Commission: ‘Communicating Europe in Partnership’, is along these same lines. We can celebrate the importance that the institutions attach to this dialogue and the efforts they intend to make so that citizens feel involved in the European Union. ']"

First of all, if the rules of the current Treaty were observed and if the sovereign decision of the Irish people were respected, the draft Treaty of Lisbon should have been abandoned. This report once again advocates an antidemocratic position. For that matter, it is unacceptable that the European Parliament should speak of further increasing ‘the transparency of the EU and the involvement of citizens in decision-making processes’ when a majority rejected the holding of referendums in their own countries on the draft Treaty of Lisbon, precisely because they were afraid of the majority opinion of their people.It is also regrettable that they are ignoring the opposing opinions of all those who feel deceived by a process of capitalist integration which is worsening inequalities and increasing poverty and unemployment, in contrast to what they promised.Even the few positive points of the report seem to be framed within a context that aims to deceive public opinion and the citizens, through propaganda campaigns, rather than effectively ensure democratic participation and bring about a change in policy to respond to the reasonable aspirations of individuals and workers.

It calls for us to complete the process of ratifying the Lisbon Treaty as soon as possible, as it is an important condition for dialogue on Europe. The report claims that the Treaty will increase transparency and involve citizens in decision making. It may give the impression that those who do not like the Treaty will be ignored, and therefore their voice will not be heard. It is therefore hard to speak of dialogue and compromise.The idea of ‘common European knowledge’ through the study of the history of Europe and European integration is also controversial. This would be brought about by a programme agreed at Community level, adopted on a voluntary basis by the Member States and paid for from the Community budget. In short, this is an historical compromise, which will serve as a tool for building common European values. In my view we do not need to go that far – historical compromise is a concept that is vague at the very least, if such a compromise is needed at all.

What is needed is to transmit, clearly and concisely, to the public, what our actions are based on, what we aim to achieve and in particular the resulting benefits to citizens. True integration is not possible if our voters do not fully accept the actions of the European Union.Studies have shown that only just over 50% of EU citizens are satisfied by their country’s membership of the Community.

233, 5. Explanations of vote,"  Ilda Figueiredo  (GUE/NGL),  in writing. – (PT) In this report, the European Parliament approves, with a few amendments, the Commission’s request to amend Directive 98/8/EC concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market. The Commission considers that this amendment has become necessary after an evaluation of the directive’s implementation showed that the 10-year period, until 14 May 2010, foreseen for the evaluation of active substances used in biocidal products with the aim of including them on the Community positive list, would not be enough. As a consequence, the transitional period, during which the biocides market will continue to be regulated by national rules, would expire without the Community positive list being established. In practice this would mean that important products, like for instance disinfectants in hospitals, would have to be taken from the market from 15 May 2010.In order to avoid this unwanted effect, the Commission proposes a prolongation of the transitional period for three years until 14 May 2013. In case even these three years are not enough, the Commission introduces the possibility of prolonging the period even further by a comitology decision.

Even the website of the current Presidency takes no account of the fact that German, with an 18% share, is the language with the most native speakers in the EU, while a further 14% of EU citizens speak it as a foreign language.This is a missed opportunity for the EU to come closer to its citizens.

The effects of the policy of multilingualism are far-reaching and obvious, but if erroneously applied the results can be pitiful.One of Europe’s virtues is its multicultural nature, which is also expressed in multilingualism. It is at the same time a common obligation that is based on needs and the difficulty of re-forging multiculturalism into a clear strength which unites the Community, which will also have an impact beyond its borders and give Europe its rightful place in the world. So the stakes are high. A bad policy of multilingualism is based on favouring one or more languages and condemning the rest to marginalisation in all spheres of public activity. Through its legislation and institutions, the European Union has huge opportunities to conduct a good language policy. That makes its responsibility in this all the greater.Mr Graça Moura’s report does not solve all the problems associated with the right of individual European languages to co-exist and with the resulting privileges. Aside from official languages, there are also a huge number of other languages spoken in Europe, and which are threatened with extinction to various degrees. A feature of a good multilingual policy would be to protect these languages. However, the report focuses more on learning the official languages than on implementing the idea of multilingualism.

286, 5. Explanations of vote,"  Luís Queiró  (PPE-DE),  in writing. – (PT) The debate on territorial cohesion is much more than a budget debate or a debate on Community policies; it is a debate on the guiding principles of one of the founding and fundamental concepts of the idea of Europe as we see it. The assessment of cohesion policy and the search for the most appropriate solutions in a Europe enlarged to 27 members, which is currently going through an economic crisis, therefore deserve our agreement and our applause. However, this does not mean that we agree with or applaud the whole content of the Green Paper.Given the criteria that we value, the three key concepts of this assessment are correct, namely: to reduce the negative effects associated with differences in population density; to connect territories in order to overcome distance; and to cooperate in order to overcome divisions.

307," 7. Preparation of the G20 Summit on 2 April - with the participation of Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Member of the European Council (debate) ","  Gordon Brown,  Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. − Mr President, for this special honour of an invitation to speak to you, and for your successful Presidency of the Parliament, let me thank you. Let me thank you, European parliamentarians and members of the European Commission, led by President Barroso: it is thanks to the work of all of you, and the generations whose work we build on, that today we enjoy a Europe of peace and unity, which will truly rank among the finest achievements of human history and which is today a beacon of hope for the whole world.(Applause)And if anyone, in any country or continent, is in any doubt about how the human will and the courage of representatives with a mission can build a new future out of past decades of despair, let them simply reflect upon how, 60 years ago, Europeans talked of enmities that were forever entrenched and relationships that could never be repaired. They talked of a hard, long and bitter Cold War. They did not believe it possible that our Europe could ever be fully at peace, far less that it could unite and cooperate.Then let them think of how today, after years of cooperation and unity, none but those on the political extremes would question that we are stronger together and safer together than ever we were apart.(Applause)On 9 November this year, we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of something that surely for each of us in this Chamber must count as one of the most defining events of our lives – the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was a wall torn down by the resolution of people determined that no barrier, no intimidation, no repression, would ever again be allowed to divide the people of Europe.Friends, today there is no old Europe, no new Europe, no East or West Europe. There is only one Europe, and it is our home Europe.I stand here proud to be British and proud to be European, representing a country that does not see itself as an island adrift from Europe but as a country at the centre of Europe – not in Europe’s slipstream but in Europe’s mainstream.(Applause)That is why I am also proud that by a large majority our British Parliament ratified the Lisbon Treaty.(Loud applause)I believe that we in Europe are uniquely placed to lead the world in meeting the wholly new and momentous challenges of globalisation ahead. We are uniquely placed because of what we have achieved in our Union. I want to thank the Members of this European Parliament. You should all be proud of what together we have achieved – the greatest and biggest single market in the world, now bringing opportunities to 500 million people, and the most successful endeavour in economic cooperation anywhere in the world. You should be proud that this is an achievement of the European Union.You should be proud, too, of the comprehensive framework of environmental protection that we are building – a defining achievement of European coordination, with this continent the first in the world to set itself unequivocally on the path to becoming a low-carbon economy.(Applause)You should be proud, too, that, through the world’s biggest programme of aid, the most sustained commitment to saving and changing lives anywhere in the world has been made by this European Union.So many of the consumer rights and workplace rights we all enjoy across Europe have resulted from the campaigns led by individual Members and groupings of this House.Let us not forget that the European Union has the most comprehensive social protection anywhere in the world – a set of rights and responsibilities that was enhanced for the people of Britain when, I am proud to say, our Government led Britain into the Social Chapter.Mr President, these successes of Europe would have been impossible without the cooperation between peoples that you and this Parliament have delivered. Yes, we can see unity advanced by officials meeting officials across frontiers. Yes, we see unity when leaders meet leaders. But the unity that will last is the democratic unity rooted in the common values of people now represented in this Parliament, and more than treaties, more than institutions, more than individuals, it is these defining values that bind us closely together – our belief, as a European Union, that liberty, economic progress and social justice advance together or not at all.These are the values rooted in the lessons we have learned by working together – the truth that freedom must never become a free-for-all, that markets should be free but never values-free, and the belief that being fair is more important than laissez-faire.We have learned again in this crisis that wealth is of no great value to society unless it serves more than the wealthy. Riches are of value only when they enrich not just some communities, but all.This is not simply our political philosophy – in Europe we believe these truths because we have lived them in the work we have done in our countries.Now, in the midst of a global crisis of a speed, scope and scale quite unprecedented in history, I want to discuss with you how, by applying these values that are now part of our DNA – these lessons we have learned over time in Europe – Europe and the world can rise to the four great challenges of globalisation: financial instability in a world of instant global capital flows; environmental degradation in a world of energy shortages; extremism and the threat it brings to security in a world of unprecedented mobility; and growing poverty in a world of worsening inequality.I want to discuss too how, with a global economy managed properly by us working together, billions of people in Asia and elsewhere, many of whom are just producers of their goods, can become tomorrow’s consumers of our goods, how we can see over the next twenty years the biggest expansion of middle class jobs and incomes ever seen, and how, despite all the problems we have today, we can see ahead a world economy that will double in size, creating new opportunities for all of us in all our countries.I want to discuss how we can build, from a world which today looks unsustainable, unsafe and unequal, a truly global society which is sustainable for all, secure for all and fair to all.Let me repeat: I believe that the European Union is uniquely placed to lead in building this future, precisely because we have proved over the last 60 years that we as Europe can meet and master the challenges of cooperation across borders, of coordination between peoples, and of building unity out of diversity.Some of you will know that for many years I have advanced the case for a global Europe, and for the economic reforms to make it happen. I know that some critics suggested that I was supporting global action more because I supported European action less. But I have made this case so strongly in recent years precisely because I passionately want Europe to be leading on the world stage, and because I believe that the countries of Europe, having come together around values of liberty, fairness and responsibility, have so much to offer the world as it, too, comes together.I want to see a globalisation that is open, free-trading and flexible, but which is also reforming, inclusive and sustainable. That is the message, at these most testing of economic times, that Europe can send to, and share with, the rest of the world.Today, as you know, an international hurricane is sweeping the world. No European country is immune from its impact. It is hitting every business, every worker, every homeowner and every family too.Let us be honest with each other: our global economic system has developed and become distorted in ways that run contrary to the values that we celebrate and uphold in our families, in our communities and in every other part of our lives – values such as being fair to others and taking responsibility, honouring hard work and not rewarding irresponsible excess.Complex products like banking derivatives, which were supposed to disperse risk around the world, have instead spread contagion. No longer can we allow risk to be transferred around the world without responsibility. I say that every part of what has been a shadow banking system must now come under the supervisory net.(Applause)Established limits to markets agreed in one country or region are being overtaken by global competition between all countries. I say that it is not enough to promote self-regulation and allow a race to the bottom: we have to agree international standards of transparency, disclosure and – yes – of remuneration too.(Applause)Just as globalisation has been crossing national boundaries, we know it has been crossing moral boundaries too. As we have discovered to our cost, the problem of unbridled free markets in an unsupervised marketplace is that they can reduce all relationships to transactions, all motivations to self-interest, all sense of value to consumer choice and all sense of worth to a price tag.Yet a good society and a good economy need a strong sense of values. Not values that spring from the market, but values we bring to the market; the solid virtues of honesty, responsibility, fairness and valuing hard work – virtues that come not from markets, but actually come from the heart.So starting at our debate today, as we prepare for the London Summit next week, I propose that we, as Europe, take a central role in replacing what was once called the Washington Consensus with a new and principled economic consensus for our times.Faced with all these global problems, we cannot stand where we are. We have to act. Of course, we have a choice, and I know the temptation for some is to meet this new insecurity by retreating – to try to feel safe by attempting to pull up the drawbridge and to turn the clock back. But I tell you that if there is anything we know from past history, it is that protectionism is the politics of defeatism, the politics of retreat and the politics of fear, and that, in the end, it protects no one at all.(Applause)Instead of heading for the rocks of isolation, let us together chart the course of cooperation. That is in all our national interests. That is why I propose that Europe take the lead in a bold plan to ensure that every continent now makes the changes in its banking system that will open the path to shared prosperity, that every country participate and cooperate in setting global standards for financial regulation, and that every continent inject the resources needed to secure economic growth and jobs.What is the agenda? First, the market is there to serve us; we are not here to serve the market. That is why we in Britain, other countries in Europe and, yesterday, America, have removed uncertainty from the banking sector in order to get lending moving again for those people who need it to get on with their ordinary lives in the midst of extraordinary times. I believe that the common principles behind the US, the UK and the European plans for cleaning up the banks’ balances sheets will help to rebuild confidence and help to restore lending to the wider economy.For the first time ever across our world, we have a consensus, reflected in the de Larosière report, the G30 report of Paul Volcker, the Turner report in the UK and the financial stability reform, that, in the interests of protecting people’s savings, tough regulatory standards should be set across Europe and across the world, and be implemented and fully monitored, not just in one country, but in every continent of the world.I believe that, for the first time, we can also agree the big changes necessary for coordinated action that will signal the beginning of the end of offshore tax havens and offshore centres.(Applause)Let us say together that our regulations should apply to every bank, everywhere, at every time, with no opt-out for a shadow banking system, and no hiding place in any part of the world for tax avoiders who are refusing to pay their fair share.We know also that a worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus to our economy can be twice as effective in every country if it is adopted by all countries. I believe that this year we are seeing the biggest cuts in interest rates the world has ever seen, and we are seeing implemented the biggest fiscal stimulus the world has ever agreed.I am confident that the London Summit can build on the action that the European Council and the G20 Finance Ministers agreed a few days ago. We will do whatever it takes to create the jobs and the growth we need. I believe that the whole of Europe will agree with President Obama in saying that our actions should be sustained and robust until recovery is achieved.We also have a responsibility to the unemployed. I believe that no one should go unemployed for months without the offer of training, a job or help to obtain a job, and that no school-leaver should be out of school and out of work for long without being offered the chance to get the skills they need for the future.I believe also that in this crisis we must take urgent, serious and large-scale action to build a low-carbon recovery and make our economies sustainable. Europe led the Industrial Revolution and now it can lead a low-carbon revolution – through investment in energy efficiency, the expansion of renewables and nuclear power, the demonstration of carbon capture and storage, the development of the smart grid, and the commercialisation of electric and ultra-low-carbon vehicles. That is why I am proud to be part of the European 2020 package on energy and climate change that we agreed in December 2008 – a decision of this Parliament also which has set the highest standards for global leadership on the road to a climate change agreement we all want to see at Copenhagen later this year.(Applause)What we are now experiencing in some of the countries of eastern and central Europe demonstrates why we must build anew the international economic cooperation to help countries whenever they are in times of need.A new, reformed, International Monetary Fund, in which we welcome greater representation from the emerging economies, and which must have at least USD 500 billion in resources – twice what it has today – must be empowered to help countries that are facing a flight of capital, help them assist restructuring the capacity of their banks and enable them to restore lending to their industries. I want an International Monetary Fund that does not just react to crises, but prevents crises, and I want a World Bank that has the resources to prevent poverty and to facilitate, amidst the collapse of trade credits, the expansion of trade around the world.As we remember and celebrate that our European Union and this Parliament have so successfully expanded to welcome new members of our family, I say to EU Member States from eastern Europe now that we will not walk away from you at any time of need. We will do all that we can to be on your side.(Applause)Let us not forget either that, for hundreds of millions of people in the poorest countries, thrust into extreme poverty, this crisis is nothing less than a matter of life and death. The grim truth is that, because banks can fail and markets and trade collapse, half a million extra children – ten and a half million children in all – will die this year because they are literally too poor to live. Ten and a half million children is not just a statistic. It is one child, then a second child, then a third child, then a fourth; each of them not just a child, but somebody’s child; each a funeral that should never have happened; each a life that could be saved – a tragedy, I believe, that strikes at the very soul of my being and yours.(Applause)Times that are difficult for us must never become the excuse for turning our backs on the poorest of the world or allowing broken banks to lead to and justify there being broken promises on aid. Instead of allowing our European aid pledges to drift towards being mere intentions, then vague aspirations, and, eventually, tragically quiet betrayals, we should instead redouble our efforts to make sure that ours is the generation that finally does make poverty history.(Applause)We can, together, deliver the biggest fiscal stimulus, the biggest cut in interest rates, the biggest reform in our international financial system, the first international principles governing banking remuneration and banking standards, the first comprehensive action around the world against tax havens and, for the first time in a world crisis, new and additional help to the poor.How do we build this global consensus for the global changes we need? Let me say that one of the great opportunities ahead for us is for Europe and every other continent to work together. Today I want to emphasise also that Europe and America can work more closely together.I talked to President Obama yesterday about what I want to talk to you about today: a new era of heightened cooperation between Europe and America. Never in recent years have we had an American leadership so keen to cooperate at all levels with Europe on financial stability, climate change, security and development. Seldom has such cooperation been so obviously of benefit to the whole world.Starting with the EU-US Summit a few days from now, when President Obama comes to Prague, we can transform that summit from just an annual meeting into an unstoppable progressive partnership to secure the global change that the world now needs.Think of all the advances we – Europe and America – in a new era of transatlantic cooperation, can work together to achieve. Let us work together for a new worldwide climate change agreement – a climate change agreement initiated at the G8 in 2005 by Chancellor Merkel – for the biggest cuts in carbon emissions the world has ever seen. Let us work together, Europe and America, to defeat the growing threat of terrorism from Pakistan and Afghanistan that can strike any of our countries’ streets at any time.With France under the leadership of President Sarkozy joining the centre of NATO again, let Europe and America work together to achieve something that was once a dream but is now, in my view, possible: a world where nuclear weapons do not proliferate and where the nuclear powers agree real reductions in their arsenals of nuclear weapons.(Applause)Let us work together also for an urgent imperative all of us want to see in our lifetimes and something that all parties in this Parliament, I believe, crave: peace in the Middle East, with a secure Israel side by side with a viable Palestinian state.(Applause)But the most immediate and the most urgently-needed gift our European and American cooperation could give is that, as a result of our actions, there will be more jobs, more businesses and more trade, as together we meet and master these great financial challenges of our time.There is a quote from one of the most famous Europeans of all, Michelangelo, that it is better to aim too high and fall short, than to aim too low and succeed. That is the choice, written by Michelangelo, that we face now, because, as I look round this Chamber today, I see that all of us here are not just witnesses and not just spectators, but potentially the makers of change, free to shape our own destiny.The people of Europe need not be mastered by events. No matter what they are, we can be master of them. So let it be said of us that, in the worst of times, in the deepest of downturns, we kept to our faith in the future and together we reshaped and renewed the world order for our times.I believe that only once the history books have been written will we be able to truly grasp the range and scale of the extraordinary challenges each country on every continent is having to deal with as a result of globalisation now. This is more than a moment of change in our common history. This is a world of change, and we should remind ourselves that the most epoch-making decades in European history have never been fully understood as they have happened.If you look back to the Renaissance, one of the greatest ages the world has ever seen, we cannot attribute its impact on the world to a single date or person or breakthrough. Or the Enlightenment – we cannot say with certainty when or by whom or how it was launched, merely that today’s Europe and today’s world could not exist without it. When we look back at the Industrial Revolution, we cannot point to the day the whistle blew and it began, or highlight just one inventor or entrepreneur or a management committee that oversaw it. We can only say today, of events that were not properly understood at the time, that we are all beneficiaries of them.In this generation we face a world of change not yet fully understood, in which we can either hasten or delay progress by the myriad of decisions that we take every day. I say, in this world of amazing change – climate change, environmental demands, energy needs, the risk of terror, poverty and inequality that has to be tackled, a financial crisis that has to be dealt with – let us not retreat into the protectionism that is the road to ruin.Let this be our legacy: that we foresaw and then shaped a truly global society for our new times; that, instead of globalisation being a force for injustice and inequality, we made globalisation a force for justice on a global scale; and that, faced with the most difficult of challenges, a united Europe, founded on shared ideals and based on shared values, helped build this world anew.(Sustained applause) ","Gordon Brown,",74,3771,not_available,"['gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla']","['  Gordon Brown,  Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. − Mr President, for this special honour of an invitation to speak to you, and for your successful Presidency of the Parliament, let me thank you.

They talked of a hard, long and bitter Cold War.

Yes, we can see unity advanced by officials meeting officials across frontiers. Yes, we see unity when leaders meet leaders. But the unity that will last is the democratic unity rooted in the common values of people now represented in this Parliament, and more than treaties, more than institutions, more than individuals, it is these defining values that bind us closely together – our belief, as a European Union, that liberty, economic progress and social justice advance together or not at all.', 'These are the values rooted in the lessons we have learned by working together – the truth that freedom must never become a free-for-all, that markets should be free but never values-free, and the belief that being fair is more important than laissez-faire.', 'We have learned again in this crisis that wealth is of no great value to society unless it serves more than the wealthy. Riches are of value only when they enrich not just some communities, but all.', 'This is not simply our political philosophy – in Europe we believe these truths because we have lived them in the work we have done in our countries.', 'Now, in the midst of a global crisis of a speed, scope and scale quite unprecedented in history, I want to discuss with you how, by applying these values that are now part of our DNA – these lessons we have learned over time in Europe – Europe and the world can rise to the four great challenges of globalisation: financial instability in a world of instant global capital flows; environmental degradation in a world of energy shortages; extremism and the threat it brings to security in a world of unprecedented mobility; and growing poverty in a world of worsening inequality.', 'I want to discuss too how, with a global economy managed properly by us working together, billions of people in Asia and elsewhere, many of whom are just producers of their goods, can become tomorrow’s consumers of our goods, how we can see over the next twenty years the biggest expansion of middle class jobs and incomes ever seen, and how, despite all the problems we have today, we can see ahead a world economy that will double in size, creating new opportunities for all of us in all our countries.', 'I want to discuss how we can build, from a world which today looks unsustainable, unsafe and unequal, a truly global society which is sustainable for all, secure for all and fair to all.', 'Let me repeat: I believe that the European Union is uniquely placed to lead in building this future, precisely because we have proved over the last 60 years that we as Europe can meet and master the challenges of cooperation across borders, of coordination between peoples, and of building unity out of diversity.', 'Some of you will know that for many years I have advanced the case for a global Europe, and for the economic reforms to make it happen. I know that some critics suggested that I was supporting global action more because I supported European action less. But I have made this case so strongly in recent years precisely because I passionately want Europe to be leading on the world stage, and because I believe that the countries of Europe, having come together around values of liberty, fairness and responsibility, have so much to offer the world as it, too, comes together.', 'I want to see a globalisation that is open, free-trading and flexible, but which is also reforming, inclusive and sustainable. That is the message, at these most testing of economic times, that Europe can send to, and share with, the rest of the world.', 'Today, as you know, an international hurricane is sweeping the world. No European country is immune from its impact. It is hitting every business, every worker, every homeowner and every family too.', 'Let us be honest with each other: our global economic system has developed and become distorted in ways that run contrary to the values that we celebrate and uphold in our families, in our communities and in every other part of our lives – values such as being fair to others and taking responsibility, honouring hard work and not rewarding irresponsible excess.', 'Complex products like banking derivatives, which were supposed to disperse risk around the world, have instead spread contagion. No longer can we allow risk to be transferred around the world without responsibility.

309," 7. Preparation of the G20 Summit on 2 April - with the participation of Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Member of the European Council (debate) ","  José Manuel Barroso,  President of the Commission. − Mr President, the G20 Summit in London will be a milestone in the global response to the global crisis. I am very confident that, under Prime Minister Brown’s leadership, it will be a success.The initiative for a global response to a global crisis came from Europe. I recall that both President Sarkozy and I went to Camp David to propose to President Bush a global response. The G20 Summit in Washington in November 2008 was precisely the result of those joint efforts.Europe has, therefore, a particular responsibility in the current G20 process. We want the London Summit to succeed, and I am sure it will succeed. Europe will be united in London and with a unified message. As agreed last week by the 27 Member States in the European Council, we will have a proactive agenda for London. We want concrete results on a stimulus for the world economy and on the regulation of all financial actors, from banks to hedge funds, to new rules on credit-rating agencies.We should be clear that there is no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving regulation – we need both. Indeed, we need to go beyond that: we need also to reject all forms of economic nationalism and protectionism and we need to renew our commitments to the less-developed world, making sure that Europe will respect the Millennium Development Goals.The economic slowdown is particularly severe. So providing a coordinated stimulus to the economy through supporting overall demand is necessary. The European Union is already doing a lot on this front: our overall fiscal effort, combining discretionary action and automatic stabilisers, is close to 4% of GDP.Now we must implement our recovery plans vigorously. We know what we have to do: to get loans flowing again; to keep people in jobs; to improve their skills for when the upturn comes; to continue to invest in productivity and European competitiveness. The Commission will monitor and evaluate what Member States are doing to coordinate our overall response to the crisis.On financial regulation, the European Union wants to move the frontier further: no financial product, no institution, no market, no jurisdiction should be exempt from regulation. But not regulation for the sake of regulating – we need further regulation because we need markets to function properly again, funding jobs and investments. Only in this way will confidence be restored, and confidence is key. Putting ethics back in the financial system is also a condition for the confidence we need in open economies.In the European Union, the frontier is already moving: proposals on capital adequacy and credit-rating agencies have been presented by the Commission and are currently being discussed also by this Parliament. Over the coming weeks the Commission will table proposals on hedge funds, private equity and executive pay and, in time for the June European Council, the Commission will put forward a package for a new European supervisory system. The European Union is moving: we will say it loud and clear in London so that we can work together with our partners, namely our American friends.We want the others to move along with us; we need global rules for a global economy. Take the case of impaired assets: clearly, without cleaning the banking system, credit will not flow back to the economy. The European Union now has a framework, provided by the Commission, to address this issue. G20 Finance Ministers discussed at length the treatment of impaired assets less than two weeks ago. The set of principles they adopted largely reflects European Union views on the matter. So, once again, we had the unique experience of setting supranational and transnational rules and show that the European Union is better prepared than anyone not to impose but to propose the rules for this globalisation.In London, the European Union must also give a strong message rejecting protectionism. We will defend our internal market at home, keeping it open, and we will work for open, global markets too. We must not give up on Doha and must reach an agreement soon. Nor can we forget the countries most in need: we must stick to our commitments on the Millennium Development Goals.We must always bear in mind that the actions we take are only the means to an end, improving people’s well-being. These are measures not for the financial system – not for that particular segment of the economy – but for people. At the current juncture, this means we must cushion and mitigate the effects on employment of the economic downturn in the European Union. Indeed, employment is our first concern now. We will hold an Employment Summit on 7 May to mobilise ideas and actions in favour of keeping people in jobs and retraining them for the jobs of the future. We are working with social partners, because we believe that is also part of our model in Europe –the idea to work together with our social partners – and we believe that in this way we can help our workers to prepare them for the jobs of the future sustainable and low carbon economy that we want European to lead.The meeting of the G20 in London will, therefore, have to deliver in quite a number of areas – a very ambitious programme. I am sure that, under the leadership of Gordon Brown and with a strong European contribution, the G20 will deliver and will build a global consensus on the international economy.(Applause) ","José Manuel Barroso,",13,924,not_available,"['gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla']","['  José Manuel Barroso,  President of the Commission. − Mr President, the G20 Summit in London will be a milestone in the global response to the global crisis. I am very confident that, under Prime Minister Brown’s leadership, it will be a success.', 'The initiative for a global response to a global crisis came from Europe. I recall that both President Sarkozy and I went to Camp David to propose to President Bush a global response. The G20 Summit in Washington in November 2008 was precisely the result of those joint efforts.', 'Europe has, therefore, a particular responsibility in the current G20 process. We want the London Summit to succeed, and I am sure it will succeed. Europe will be united in London and with a unified message. As agreed last week by the 27 Member States in the European Council, we will have a proactive agenda for London. We want concrete results on a stimulus for the world economy and on the regulation of all financial actors, from banks to hedge funds, to new rules on credit-rating agencies.', 'We should be clear that there is no dichotomy between stimulating the economy and improving regulation – we need both. Indeed, we need to go beyond that: we need also to reject all forms of economic nationalism and protectionism and we need to renew our commitments to the less-developed world, making sure that Europe will respect the Millennium Development Goals.', 'The economic slowdown is particularly severe. So providing a coordinated stimulus to the economy through supporting overall demand is necessary. The European Union is already doing a lot on this front: our overall fiscal effort, combining discretionary action and automatic stabilisers, is close to 4% of GDP.', 'Now we must implement our recovery plans vigorously.

310," 7. Preparation of the G20 Summit on 2 April - with the participation of Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Member of the European Council (debate) ","  Joseph Daul,  on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. – (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who will host a G20 summit in a few days’ time at which Europe is awaited as rarely before.The first lesson to be learned from the crisis is that economies are now so interconnected that national solutions have become unthinkable. The difficulties which, it must be said, are coming at us mainly from the United States as the result of a lack of regulation, have gained ground and Europe, Mr Brown, needs to understand that it will only be strong if it speaks with one voice to defend its common interests. It even needs to be strong enough to drag all the regional economies onto the path towards new growth. I cannot forget Mr Manuel Barroso and the fact that it is under the impetus of Europe – and Nicolas Sarkozy in particular – that the G20 has been called upon to help restore order to a financial system which has lost the plot.Solidarity and responsibility are Europe’s two major principles. Collectively, we are ready to come to the aid of and support those of us who are experiencing the most difficulties. Even though I wish your country the best, Prime Minister, the most recent IMF figures on it are, unfortunately, very worrying for you, as they are in other countries in the European Union, especially Hungary.I worked as a voluntary fireman for several years and I know that when a house is on fire, it does not take long before the neighbour’s house is also at danger from the flames.My fellow Members, your friends, on the left of the House will doubtless call, when I have finished, for a more social Europe and more protection. Before they do so, I would reply that these simplistic slogans which involve spending money which we do not have are precisely those which resulted in the failure of the policies of the 1980s in many European countries.(Applause)Not yours of course, Prime Minister; I acknowledge that, in the 1980s, it was not your government. The same Members will not fail to repeat that the current crisis has been born of globalisation and the market economy. I would reply to them in advance that, thanks to this market economy, the average income of our fellow citizens has risen by 40% over the last 40 years. I would also remind them that, while people in countries outside the market economy, under the shelter of the Berlin Wall, met their well-documented fate, globalisation and the market economy enabled Western Europeans to prosper at an average rate of 2% growth per annum. All of which goes to show that the defenders of social Europe are not necessarily who we think they are.Prime Minister, European integration has always been a question of solidarity between the citizens of its countries and, in the difficult period we are currently experiencing, the duty of Europe, more than ever, is to prove this once again through its deeds. Supporting the banks was necessary because it prevented those who trusted in them from losing everything, and that is something, but it is not enough. Our first concern must be to stand by those who lose their jobs and families who have trouble making ends meet. It is only by returning to growth, it is only by restoring an economic and fiscal environment conducive to entrepreneurs that we shall experience a return to confidence and jobs. The EUR 400 billion European aid programme will help us overcome the crisis. It will allow new investments to be generated, it will strengthen demand and, by the same token, it will support growth and create jobs.The internal European market may act as an important lever and, by contrast, any protectionist measure will only exacerbate things. Mr Brown, it is not enough to condemn protectionism abroad. We must also avoid sanctioning slogans like ‘British jobs for British workers’ at home, because that will get us caught up in very dangerous economic nationalism. However, I trust the Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, to ensure that the law is respected and that our enterprises can trade on a free and fair market. Our priority is to set up a new global financial architecture with more stability, more supervision and, above all, more transparency. We need to speed up the ‘Basel II’ reforms and bring speculative funds under strict control.Prime Minister, I appreciate that you have come here not to impose ideas but to listen to the citizens’ expectations.

It is an excellent direction.(Applause) (FR) As regards the comments by my fellow Member, Mr Daul, the least that one can expect from the chairman of a parliamentary group in the European Parliament is that he is capable of distinguishing between protectionism and social protection. There is a huge difference.(Applause)As for your grand President, Mr Sarkozy, he may know something about protectionism, but there is one thing he certainly knows nothing about and that is social protection. (DE) You are right, Mr President, it is indeed a great moment. On the eve of the G20 Summit, Gordon Brown has come here to speak in front of the European Parliament. This visit demonstrates that the forum for the European peoples, this Parliament, is exactly the right place to present the outlook which you, Prime Minister, have described to us today.For this reason, your visit is more than simply a visit to the European Parliament. It points the way ahead, because it shows that you, as the Prime Minister of your country and as the host of the G20 Summit, give the European Parliament the importance it deserves. By this I mean that you regard it as the place where multinational and international policy must be discussed within the framework of the continental relationships of Europe and of Europe’s relationships with other parts of the world. Thank you very much for this, Mr Brown. You have done the right thing.(Applause)Prime Minister, you mentioned three fundamental principles which I would like to take up, because they are also fundamental principles of our movement. It is not greed, individual greed, which was the decisive factor. This has been a permanent feature of human history and will always exist. This is about a system in which this individual greed can spread and become destructive. It is this system which is wrong. This system of unrestrained market radicalism and liberalism has failed and has become bankrupt. This is why it must be changed.Therefore, you are right in saying that we need European and worldwide regulation for private equity, hedge funds and offshore centres, which must be closed, and we need rules for credit-rating agencies. In addition, short selling must be banned. This represents a whole raft of measures which we, under the leadership of Mr Rasmussen and in the face of opposition from the other groups, have been demanding for a long time. This is precisely what must be done.(Applause from the left)I know, fellow Members on the right, that it is difficult for you to accept that a policy which you have been promoting for 10 years has proved to be the wrong one. You are having difficulties in keeping up with what is happening. I can understand that, but it does not change the fact that you were always opposed to the policy.You are right when you state that the nuclear arms race must be stopped. You are right in saying that cooperation with the United States of America will allow us to enter a new age of nuclear disarmament. You are also right that we need solidarity between people in society, but also solidarity between states. Therefore, I will be signing on behalf of my group to ensure that the new states in this union can rely on the union. This is indeed the right road to take, Prime Minister.I would like to make one final point. Please go to the G20 with the message that anyone who attempts, in the current economic crisis, to play off environmental policy against economic policy is making a disastrous mistake. The economic crisis will pass, but climate change will remain. This is why we need both things. Above all we need an effective struggle for a better climate policy. This struggle will also provide opportunities for creating many new jobs. Combining these two things is exactly the right approach.(Applause)Gordon Brown has given a great speech.

My group congratulates you and your colleagues in the European Council for mapping out the contours of a common approach, albeit on a more limited agenda, to the summit next week.Opportunities to work with the Obama Administration should not be spoilt by a transatlantic war of words. I know we share that view, but America retains its affection for skeletal regulation, and the reality of this recession shows that those who wilfully ignored bad practice are now suffering most. We need a European financial services authority. By all means press others to support the same standards, but caution from them cannot condone inaction from us. As you say, we need to lock honesty, transparency and the rule of law into the financial system. Reform of global financial institutions is necessary too, to stop current account surpluses and excess liquidity fuelling global boom and bust.We need the IMF to fill that role. Can it assemble more assets with increased access to crisis funds? Should it become a real asset manager for parts of the global savings pool, second-guessing speculators, preventing panic, stabilising markets? How can we reform its decision-making structures to reflect the demand for more democratic oversight and the power of emerging economies?It is crucial too, despite the pain of recession, to confront the challenge of climate change and the problems posed by poverty.Prime Minister, you spoke about the need for action, so will you give the IMF and the World Bank an explicit mandate to tackle the drought, flooding and disease that accompany global warming in the developing world? Will you make sure they grant, lend and plan not just for market success, but to achieve social progress and green goals too? We need a new and sustainable economy enshrined in a global social contract. The era of easy money is past. For future growth, making a living must not equate to making a killing.But to achieve these things Europe must marshal consensus, and the UK must be part of it.

Prime Minister, I expect the single currency to emerge stronger from this crisis. In the chill winds of recession, investors have sheltered under the euro’s wing.

313," 7. Preparation of the G20 Summit on 2 April - with the participation of Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Member of the European Council (debate) ","  Brian Crowley,  on behalf of the UEN Group. – Mr President, rather than being hoisted on the petard of socialism, liberalism, conservatism or any other of the ideological ‘isms’ which are bandied about this House on a regular basis, I want first of all to congratulate the Prime Minister on his willingness to come here to present a case, to defend it strongly, but most importantly of all to offer a bridge between Europe and America with regard to how we can solve some of the problems and difficulties that are laid before us, particularly because we now stand at a time of a global crisis. But that global crisis should not be allowed to forget the successes of the past.Over the last 15 years we have had unprecedented economic growth, unprecedented employment growth, unprecedented wealth creation and unprecedented action with regard to helping and assisting the developing world. These new plans that we come forward with should not be about throwing out the baby with the bath water. It should be about building on the successes that were there, recognising the failures that had been made and ensuring that we can both chart an ambitious plan forward for a global recovery predicated on common goals of common values with a common course. That common course must at all times be based on the necessity of delivering better things for people, not better things for markets or better things for the economy.Prime Minister, you quoted Michelangelo in your speech earlier on, and there is another good quote from an Irish poet, Oscar Wilde, when he said: ‘We are all lying in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars’. And we can reach the stars now! This new crisis presents an opportunity. Barack Obama has rightly seen an opportunity to bring America back onto the world stage. The reality is that, compared with the Marshall Plan after the Second World War, there is no big beast on the world stage today that can rescue the rest of the world economy.

Social protection for those most in need is a necessity for development, but let us not be hung up on saying how much money a banker will get is the determining factor of what kind of a solution we come up with.

Let us show them that there is a way out of this crisis, that there is light at the end of the tunnel, but most importantly of all, let us show them that they are part of the solution.In the Irish language we have a saying called meitheal; that is, people coming together, operating together to save the harvest.

But that global crisis should not be allowed to forget the successes of the past.', 'Over the last 15 years we have had unprecedented economic growth, unprecedented employment growth, unprecedented wealth creation and unprecedented action with regard to helping and assisting the developing world. These new plans that we come forward with should not be about throwing out the baby with the bath water. It should be about building on the successes that were there, recognising the failures that had been made and ensuring that we can both chart an ambitious plan forward for a global recovery predicated on common goals of common values with a common course. That common course must at all times be based on the necessity of delivering better things for people, not better things for markets or better things for the economy.', 'Prime Minister, you quoted Michelangelo in your speech earlier on, and there is another good quote from an Irish poet, Oscar Wilde, when he said: ‘We are all lying in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars’. And we can reach the stars now! This new crisis presents an opportunity. Barack Obama has rightly seen an opportunity to bring America back onto the world stage. The reality is that, compared with the Marshall Plan after the Second World War, there is no big beast on the world stage today that can rescue the rest of the world economy.

(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister, you, together with a fair number of your colleagues and our own President Barroso, are responsible for the fact that the European Union does not have any financial regulation instruments or fiscal and budgetary policies that today would be so valuable in allowing us to tackle the crisis. It is good to remember that because, when the aim is to propose credible solutions, it is good manners to admit that mistakes were initially made.So let us look at the credibility of this crusade against tax havens. They seem a very easy target – everyone hates them – but the reality is slightly different. There is even a suspicion that we talk about them so much because we cannot agree on much else to talk about.Prime Minister, we believe that it is important to stop thinking that it is impossible to limit free movement of capital, and that the millions of euro squandered on speculation cannot be put to good use. We must stop, not regulate, the actions of speculative funds. We must bring the banks back to a point where they do the job for which they were invented in Tuscany many centuries ago: financing the real economy.Stepping up market surveillance is not enough; we must cut the profits of those who speculate. It should be pointed out that the mafia today has EUR 120 billion stashed away in tax havens. We must aim decisively for double declarations and double transparency: those who deposit money in another country must declare it. Banks which receive deposits must declare them.

You spoke of the ecological rehabilitation of the environment. Yet under your government’s plan, only 7% of investment is going towards environmental projects, while South Korea and China and even the United States are setting a pace that our fine words will be unable to keep up with.You spoke of Copenhagen, but again, the European Council did not reach an agreement on a climate-change fund for developing countries.

The European Union has followed others in succumbing to this temptation. The fathers of this new model or their successors have today been overtaken by their now unmanageable creature. In order to get through what is also an existential crisis, we first have to dare to question.

That is what will change us.I think, Prime Minister, that you are the first European political leader to have taken your turn in sketching a mea culpa.

My goodness me, you showed that this afternoon, Prime Minister.It is just a pity that, apart from UKIP, virtually nobody seems to have bothered to turn up to listen to you. You are very popular here. You are very popular indeed because within a few days of the Irish saying ‘no’ to the Lisbon Treaty, you had rammed that Treaty through the British Parliament, breaking a specific manifesto pledge that you would give the British people a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty.Shame on you, Prime Minister, for doing that. You have devalued democracy in our country; you have devalued the trust that voters put in you as a British Prime Minister. Of course, we know the reason why. The reason why is that we would have voted ‘no’. You said in your speech that none but those on the extremes oppose European Union.

318," 7. Preparation of the G20 Summit on 2 April - with the participation of Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Member of the European Council (debate) ","  Gordon Brown,  Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. − Mr President, it is a real tribute to this European Parliament that you can have so many diverse views expressed in such a short period of time by so many people, and I thank you for your views.I hope, however, that even after the party politics has subsided, we will remember three things. First of all, that it is important that the world comes together to deal with this crisis. For us to sit apart, to be aloof, not to cooperate with other countries, is a recipe for failure and for an inability to solve a problem that is actually a global banking failure that has spread across the industrial economy. If we do not understand the problem, we will not be able to understand the solution.We had a power cut right across the banking system right across the world. We found that banks that we thought were independent were completely entangled with other banks in different countries, and we have to deal with that problem. Whatever the party political lines that people want to adopt on this, this is the truth: we have to deal with the problem of global banking restructuring.Europe did lead the way. We recapitalised our banks. Other countries have now done that. More than a trillion dollars has been spent on recapitalising banks across the world. We have now created insurance schemes and other schemes to deal with the impaired assets. This has to be done and it has to be done by global cooperation.The second thing we have to realise, despite all the different political views in this Parliament, is that global cooperation – not just in banking institutions, but global cooperation in other areas, in fiscal and monetary policy and in trade – has to be a very important part of how we approach the future. Like it or like it not, the world is changing incredibly fast. More manufacturing is being done in Asia than in Europe. There is trade round the world at a speed that we have never seen before until this crisis, and we have to deal with that by creating a global trading environment which is free, but also fair. Whatever the views in this Parliament, I think people have to face up to that as well.The third thing that comes out of this discussion for me is that to have global solutions to global problems we will also need not just our European institutions to be strong, but our global institutions to be strong. I was asked by people who were replying to my speech what we could do to reform these global institutions. The IMF, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organisation are all organisations built in the 1940s to deal with the problems of the 1940s. We are in the year 2009. We had national capital markets. We now have global capital markets. We had domestic competition. We now have global competition. The world has changed fundamentally, and we need institutions that reflect a global economy in the way they operate and deal with the problems we have.I was asked whether I would ensure, or try to ensure, that the International Monetary Fund had the resources necessary to deal with the problems of economies that could not at the moment sustain themselves when there was a flight of capital. The answer is: we must do that. I was asked whether the World Bank and other international institutions can help countries where there is substantial poverty being created as a result of the crisis. We have got to do that. I believe that the lesson of this crisis is that we are now in a global economy. There are global problems that need global solutions. That will require us to shape global institutions, and my message to this Parliament is very clear. Europe has led the way in so many other areas: it is now time to lead the way in creating the global institutions that will deal with the global problems we have, and provide global solutions.This is a test of how we, having over the last 60 years created a Europe which has social protection as well as economic progress, can help shape a world where we have economic progress, environmental care and social justice at the same time. I believe that, whatever the different views expressed in this Parliament, there is a will across the peoples of this world to do that, and we, Europe, can play a major role in it.(Loud applause) ","Gordon Brown,",9,771,not_available,"['gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla', 'gla']","['  Gordon Brown,  Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. − Mr President, it is a real tribute to this European Parliament that you can have so many diverse views expressed in such a short period of time by so many people, and I thank you for your views.', 'I hope, however, that even after the party politics has subsided, we will remember three things.

Whatever the party political lines that people want to adopt on this, this is the truth: we have to deal with the problem of global banking restructuring.', 'Europe did lead the way. We recapitalised our banks. Other countries have now done that. More than a trillion dollars has been spent on recapitalising banks across the world. We have now created insurance schemes and other schemes to deal with the impaired assets. This has to be done and it has to be done by global cooperation.', 'The second thing we have to realise, despite all the different political views in this Parliament, is that global cooperation – not just in banking institutions, but global cooperation in other areas, in fiscal and monetary policy and in trade – has to be a very important part of how we approach the future. Like it or like it not, the world is changing incredibly fast. More manufacturing is being done in Asia than in Europe. There is trade round the world at a speed that we have never seen before until this crisis, and we have to deal with that by creating a global trading environment which is free, but also fair. Whatever the views in this Parliament, I think people have to face up to that as well.', 'The third thing that comes out of this discussion for me is that to have global solutions to global problems we will also need not just our European institutions to be strong, but our global institutions to be strong. I was asked by people who were replying to my speech what we could do to reform these global institutions. The IMF, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organisation are all organisations built in the 1940s to deal with the problems of the 1940s. We are in the year 2009. We had national capital markets. We now have global capital markets. We had domestic competition. We now have global competition. The world has changed fundamentally, and we need institutions that reflect a global economy in the way they operate and deal with the problems we have.', 'I was asked whether I would ensure, or try to ensure, that the International Monetary Fund had the resources necessary to deal with the problems of economies that could not at the moment sustain themselves when there was a flight of capital. The answer is: we must do that. I was asked whether the World Bank and other international institutions can help countries where there is substantial poverty being created as a result of the crisis. We have got to do that. I believe that the lesson of this crisis is that we are now in a global economy. There are global problems that need global solutions. That will require us to shape global institutions, and my message to this Parliament is very clear. Europe has led the way in so many other areas: it is now time to lead the way in creating the global institutions that will deal with the global problems we have, and provide global solutions.', 'This is a test of how we, having over the last 60 years created a Europe which has social protection as well as economic progress, can help shape a world where we have economic progress, environmental care and social justice at the same time. I believe that, whatever the different views expressed in this Parliament, there is a will across the peoples of this world to do that, and we, Europe, can play a major role in it.', '(Loud applause) ']"

The EU guarantees the loans in such a way that the lender does not incur any losses and it may finance its own borrowing further with market money.When the EU’s guarantees in respect of the European Investment Bank were renewed and extended to cover more countries than before, it was the European Parliament’s view that the decisions should come under the codecision procedure and, furthermore, fall within the competence of the European Parliament, and not just that of the Council. The European Court of Justice agreed and, accordingly, the Council’s unilateral decision was remitted back to the codecision procedure. The new decision is to be taken by 6 November this year.Now before us is the Commission’s proposal for a decision, which may be regarded as temporary, and regarding which the Commission will be allowed up to the end of April next year to prepare a new, general proposal. Parliament has left its fingerprints on the ‘temporary’ decision, and the Council has accepted that. It is a positive sign that, after some tricky negotiations, there is now consensus between the Council and Parliament and that the decision can be taken today at first reading, without the need for any further deliberation.In this connection I wish to thank the representatives of the Czech Presidency, who have worked so hard in the Council to bring about consensus. But for the active participation of the Czech Republic, this decision would never have come into being.All the same, I do have to censure all those who stirred things up at the European Investment Bank. The European Investment Bank is accustomed to receiving the support of the European Parliament in its various affairs, but its representatives this time have failed to realise that the codecision procedure had been brought into play and that Parliament’s competence in this matter had been extended significantly. Parliament wanted to exercise its powers fully, which was not possible at the earlier consultation procedures. It was, I think, completely inappropriate that the European Investment Bank, which is one of the institutions of the EU, should not have shown some respect for Parliament’s established practices, but instead tried to influence the decision from the political periphery.It is, nevertheless, a good end result. The European Investment Bank mainly got what it wanted. It earned Parliament’s sympathy in a decision-making procedure in which Parliament formed its own opinion. This decision now has the vast consensus of the political groups behind it, whereas it would not have if the European Investment Bank’s approach had been adopted. I would like to thank the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for achieving this compromise.

EIB and EBRD annual reports for 2007 - Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank (debate) ,"  Gay Mitchell,  rapporteur. − Mr President, can I say at the outset that I really do strongly object to the way Members of Parliament have their time shortened here. Question Time is not being heard this week, either by the Council or the Commission. People can come in here and speak at all sorts of great length. Members of Parliament introducing reports on behalf of Parliament are shortened without notice. This is an outrageous imposition on MEPs.As rapporteur, I would first like to welcome President Maystadt and President Mirow to the Chamber on this first time that Parliament has drafted a report on the activities of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) concurrently. There can be no doubting the fact that the current financial crisis has highlighted the importance of the work of the EIB and the EBRD. Both banks are to be praised for their efforts in tackling the effects of the economic crisis. They are both facing up to the challenges presented, and I commend them for this. It is important that we consider both banks at the same time, so as to ensure better cooperation between them and the elimination of overlap.Both banks should ensure that there is maximum synergy so as to prepare for and assist economic recovery. The decision to increase lending to small and medium-sized enterprises by 50% is particularly welcome. The initially planned EUR 5 billion per year for SME lending has been increased to EUR 7.5 billion per year over the four year period 2008-2011.An example of new funding is the EUR 310 million approved recently by the EIB for investment in SMEs in Ireland. The EIB has made it clear that more can be made available, and at very competitive interest rates, to Irish SMEs and to other SMEs. In my view, Europe needs to think in terms of a Marshall Aid-type plan, which worked so well after the Second World War.If the EIB could be persuaded to, say, borrow from China to invest in the Bank, it could use such resources to help kick-start the economic recovery and bring this about sooner. This borrowing could be repaid by committing part of the extra customs duties that would be collected by the EU from renewed external trade and some of the new VAT receipts to this objective. This would have the added benefit of taking the pressure off EU Member States and their individual requirements to keep within the Stability and Growth Pact in terms of additional borrowing.In 2007, EU inward investment in China was EUR 7.16 billion, while China’s inward investment in the EU was only EUR 0.6 billion. Both the EU and China would benefit from increased trade. I am conscious of the visit to China by the President of the Commission, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the President of the European Central Bank before Christmas. The recent EU-China follow-up summit is a welcome sign of hope.We got into a mess because we were not focusing on the issues. It is time to start focusing on recovery, including making the EU more competitive, as proposed by the Lisbon Treaty. I am very pleased about the proposals which are being made in the context of the energy crisis and climate control and, in particular, the role of the EIB in this. I am also pleased that the recent decision of the Court on codecision has been announced and that Parliament will now have an enhanced role in relation to these two banks.I have proposed in my report – and it has been endorsed by the committee and I am sure will be endorsed by Parliament – that the Commission and the two banks should come before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on a regular basis to account for the coordination of the roles, and for the implementation of the policies, of both banks. I think this will be a very useful development. What we need is more transparency and more accountability. We heard Prime Minister Brown talking about this in terms of the international financial crisis. We should be thinking about it in terms of accountability to this House for our own financial institutions and those that are part-funded by financial institutions.I welcome the general thrust of the intent of the banks, particularly in relation to climate control and energy, and I hope the House will support the main thrust of the report which I have brought forward.

Before this House, I want to thank them both, and also their institutions, for their extremely positive cooperation with the Commission, particularly during this difficult struggle with the economic crisis.Mr Seppänen, thank you very much for your words and for your efforts as rapporteur on a subject which has been difficult, but which has had a happy outcome, as you yourself have said; namely, the agreement at first reading to solve the legal problems that had arisen surrounding the external mandate of the European Investment Bank or EIB.This external mandate allows us, through the actions of the EIB and in coordination with European policies, to take very firm and effective action on policies and areas of special interest to the European Union and to all the European institutions, including this Parliament.The Commission expresses its satisfaction that, from now on, Parliament will be directly involved in discussions on this external mandate. However, we must also warmly thank both Parliament and the Council for the flexibility that they have shown in reaching agreement quickly enough to avoid creating or increasing uncertainty, before the end of this year, over the possibility of continuing to use the resources and tools of this external mandate.For our part, the next Commission will, at the beginning of 2010, present the corresponding legal text to this Parliament and the Council. We hope that once again at first reading, we will be able to ensure legal stability for an external mandate that, as I said before, allows European policies of interest to us all to be developed.I also want to congratulate Mr Mitchell and thank him for his report. This is the first time that a report has referred not only to the European Investment Bank, but also to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, or EBRD. We feel it is right to deal with these two financial institutions together, particularly at the current time when the effectiveness of their actions must serve to reinforce our policies on the economic crisis, and when cooperation between these two institutions is especially important.We are asking both banks to make a huge effort. In the recovery plan adopted at the end of last year, we asked both institutions to considerably increase their lending capacity at a time when they too are finding it difficult to raise finance from the markets.They are responding to this call for increased activity by acting in those areas which we feel are a priority, as Mr Mitchell has said, such as small and medium-sized enterprises, the energy efficiency sector and other areas as well. In particular, we are extremely satisfied with the agreement reached by both banks with the World Bank, in a joint initiative to strengthen their financial instruments and improve their efficiency in the use of their lending instruments in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which are experiencing an especially difficult situation.We hope that, between now and next year, the groundwork and discussions of the group of experts set up by the Council and the Commission, in agreement with Mr Maystadt, to consider the future of the EIB’s external mandate, and also the strategic review of the EBRD, which will also take place at the beginning of the next term of this Parliament and the next Commission, will allow us, at a calmer time than currently in terms of the economic situation, to continue using their know-how, lending facilities, financial resources, human resources and experience to assist the policies that we all agree must be the ones to guide the future direction of the European Union in the next decade.

EIB and EBRD annual reports for 2007 - Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank (debate) ,"  Gabriele Stauner,  draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to summarise the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control on the annual report of the European Investment Bank.The Committee on Budgetary Control calls on the EIB to play a more active role and to introduce a more active policy to combat fraud, involving zero tolerance for fraud, corruption, money laundering and terrorism financing. Independently of any efforts that the EIB has made in the past, which deserve our recognition, it must now pursue a policy which is not only recorded on paper, but also involves concrete measures and transparency criteria for the purposes of traceability. Therefore, companies which have been shown to be corrupt should not be allowed to take out loans and informers should receive effective protection. The investigative and preventative function of the EIB must play a more prominent role than it has done in the past.In particular, in consideration of the current financial and economic crisis, we want the same supervisory regulations to apply to the EIB as to all other commercial banks, because without real supervisory control, the EIB cannot be a credible player on the credit market. We also need independent monitoring structures which will ensure the quality of the EIB’s results and its adherence to the code of conduct.Our main concern is that Parliament should in future produce a separate report on the work of the EIB. In our opinion a report of this kind would be both possible and appropriate, because the Member States are the only shareholders of the EIB, which means that it has a direct link with, and therefore a direct budgetary responsibility to, Parliament.

Certainly we need to work out some sort of long-term division of labour between the two institutions and to make closer cooperation possible. I saw that the rapporteur assigned major projects to the European Investment Bank, leaving activities relating to smaller enterprises to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In any case, I believe that some sort of advantageous specialisation is necessary.I am pleased that the European Parliament can at last enter Mecca and debate the kinds of future orientations that should be adopted in this regard. I am cautious with regard to this question of turning outward and inward. Twelve years ago in Hungary we believed that we could forget about the IMF once and for all, and now here they are at our gates, and we are running to them for credit.A few years ago we thought that the EBRD would not play a major role in those Member States, for instance, which are outside the euro area, and that the EBRD would instead move eastwards; now we are pleased that along with the World Bank, these two institutions have made a large Central European fund possible.I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the liquidity and financing of small and medium-sized enterprises is, to my mind – as Chairman of the relevant working group in my political group – absolutely essential; therefore, I would ask that the options that have recently been decided should enter into force as soon as possible, so that together with the commercial banks we may effectively provide the possibility of liquidity primarily to Central European small and medium-sized enterprises.

EIB and EBRD annual reports for 2007 - Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank (debate) ,"  Udo Bullmann,  on behalf of the PSE Group. – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing the current economic crisis in terms of a problem of imbalance, with a deregulated market on the one hand and a lack of public interest on the other hand. We have not always succeeded in arousing public interest in the financial markets and in the real economic processes. This is why it is so important today that we are discussing the public investment banks, which are at exactly this interface, which allow the market to function and which have a public mandate to represent our future interests. Therefore, my prediction for the presidents of these banks who are here with us today is that we will need them even more in the future than we do at the moment and have done in the past.Mr Mitchell’s report has two areas of emphasis. He urges us to find a good division of labour, an optimum position for focusing on strengths. He also proposes that we allow the two banks to concentrate on the tasks which face us in future. These are climate change, the concern that we will be threatened with mass unemployment and recession, unless we take countermeasures, and the call, in particular from small and medium-sized enterprises, for public infrastructure, so that we can make progress, create some breathing space and give ourselves a perspective on the situation. Therefore, I would like to thank Mr Mitchell for his good work. He has produced a positive report. The European Parliament has fought to retain its role and will perform its role more forcefully in future. That is the message from my group.One more comment to Mrs Stauner who has just referred to the supervisory regulations. Of course, public banks must be subject to supervisory regulations and to proper controls. However, the same supervisory regulations cannot be applied to them as to normal banks, otherwise they would not be in a position to take on the risks which we often want them to accept.

Over recent years a large section of the public has hardly been aware of their presence. I hope that in times of financial and economic crisis this will now change, because these important European institutions are becoming more significant than ever.Given the large amounts of money which both banks handle and allocate in the form of loans, it is crucial that they work according to clear criteria and principles. The fact that these are public institutions is not in itself a guarantee that this is the case. We have public banks, for example in Germany, which have breached these principles and have got into difficulties, in just the same way as many private banks. I hope that both institutions, the EIB and the EBRD, set their priorities on the basis of very clear considerations and that these priorities will in future, when we look back on this period, be seen as correct and realistic.The important thing is, and I can only support the banks in this respect, that they continue to focus on medium-sized companies, which are the backbone of the European economy, and that they focus on projects which clearly fulfil the criterion of sustainability. The banks have a very good rating, better than triple-A. This enables them to obtain and provide financing on relatively favourable terms. We must ensure that we do not place them under excessive strain and, particularly in times of crisis, do not attempt to use them as a source of capital in areas where other sources of capital may already be drying up.I am pleased that the Members of the European Parliament will be involved in identifying the priorities from next year onwards. I believe that the fact that the banks are even more accountable to Parliament than they have been in the past will form the basis for good and constructive cooperation.One last point: I would encourage both banks to increase their efforts and to make sure that they do not duplicate their activities. They should instead supplement each other’s work and work together in a complementary way.It also seems important to me that the EBRD continues to play a role in the transition countries, because we must not abandon these countries, especially in times of crisis.

We are in favour of extending the activities of the European Investment Bank in the developing countries. We have long campaigned for EIB project funding to adhere to social and environmental standards and to uphold human rights. In practical terms this will now happen because of the Community guarantees for EIB projects. We would like to thank the Committee on Budgets which has taken up this point and successfully followed it through with the Council.The EIB is a very important tool within the EU, which enables the social, environmental and economic development of the Member States to be controlled. I would therefore ask for closer checks than those that have been carried out in the past on all projects supported by the EIB, to determine whether socio-environmental sustainability and profitability can really be guaranteed. This is especially important in the current financial and economic crisis.For example, it would be a serious mistake for the EIB to support large-scale projects such as the bridge over the Straits of Messina or the Brenner base tunnel for high-speed passenger trains. These projects require large amounts of machinery and are highly capital-intensive. Support for modernising and extending existing infrastructures is far more beneficial in terms of the labour market and environmental impact.The quantitative growth comes from an outdated philosophy of ‘faster, higher, further’.

The EIB has taken upon itself the role of lender to banks and companies, with the aim of supporting the profits of capital.The European Union's recovery measures are accompanied by mandatory measures of financial prudence.

The Commission proposed the codecision procedure and tomorrow we are to vote on the compromise agreed during the trialogue and bring this codecision procedure to a close.It is important to remember that the EIB was originally set up to finance operations within the EU. So the Community guarantee to the EIB against losses and loan guarantees are the basis for its activities outside the EU.

338, 9. EIB and EBRD annual reports for 2007 - Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank (debate) ,"  Thomas Mirow,  EBRD. − Mr President, thank you very much for this report and the chance to continue the discussion begun with the committee in November. It is timely and welcome in particular for three reasons.First, the context of the financial and economic crisis renders any encouragement of greater cooperation between EBRD and EIB more relevant than ever. Yet the crisis also means that cooperation between public international financial institutions is no longer just a policy-driven aspiration but a vital necessity.Faced with the dramatic decline in private flows of credit, we came together last month with the World Bank group to launch the joint IFI action plan in support of banking systems and lending to the real economy in central and eastern Europe.This is a EUR 24.5 billion package over 2009 and 2010 of which the EBRD will contribute EUR 6 billion. The action plan recognises that an effective crisis response in Europe’s integrated financial markets requires fast and coordinated action by all stakeholders: parent banks which own a large part of the region’s financial sectors; important local banks; home and host country authorities of cross-border banking groups; European institutions and the IFIs. With this wide range of stakeholders we are working together to implement the plan and are developing the coordination and cooperation mechanisms to do so.And we see – as we saw last August when faced with the conflict-driven banking crisis in Georgia – that this kind of IFI cooperation, born of need, is the kind that works best.Second, under the aegis of the European Union, new structures of cooperation between EBRD and EIB offer great new opportunities for us to work together.I refer in particular to the Western Balkans investment framework, now being launched, as well as to the Eastern Partnership announced by the European Council in recent days which will build on the good cooperation we have already established through our memorandum of understanding and the neighbourhood investment facility.These initiatives, facilitated by EC funds, bring us together to work concretely on specific projects and programmes combining the strength of each institution and, as such, offer an excellent crucible in which to forge the development of our joint work.I believe it is in this context that we may find divisions of labour, applications of joint expertise and the necessary mechanisms of cooperation, including common standards, which you have called for.Third, I take the European Parliament’s views as welcome input to the early stages of the EBRD’s fourth capital resources review which we will conclude at our annual meeting in Zagreb in May 2010.The EBRD has taken a proactive stance in response to the crisis: supporting our clients in countries of operations, we are expanding our instruments, and aim to invest EUR 7 billion in 2009 – an increase of more than 20%.At the same time, we have to acknowledge that our risk exposure is also increasing. The full implications of the current situation on our portfolio and on the development of our business cannot yet be clearly seen. Yet the importance of our partnership with the EIB and with the European Union in meeting our commitments, both to our shareholders and to our countries of operations, is clearer than ever.

340, 9. EIB and EBRD annual reports for 2007 - Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank (debate) ,"  Philippe Maystadt,  President of the EIB. – (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank you for once again giving us the opportunity to pursue the constructive dialogue that has been established between the European Investment Bank and Parliament for some years now.I am particularly happy to have the opportunity to discuss the two reports being presented to us today, because they are two reports – that of Mr Mitchell and that of Mr Seppänen – that are interesting and that raise entirely relevant issues. I hope that we will have the opportunity to return to these issues later.Today, of course, we are facing a crisis on an exceptional scale – probably the most serious crisis since the end of the Second World War – and it is therefore quite normal in this context for Member States to call on our two institutions to try to make a contribution to the European Union’s response to this crisis. You know that in this context the Member States, which are our shareholders, have asked the EIB to substantially increase the volume of its lending in 2009, an increase of some 30% compared to the initial forecasts, and to channel this additional effort essentially into three areas: firstly, loans to banks for small and medium-sized enterprises; secondly, energy, and in particular the fight against climate change; and finally, a special effort for those countries that are hardest hit by the crisis.What point have we reached today? I will give you the statistics covering the last three months of 2008 – in other words, starting from the time at which the first appeals were made to the EIB – and the first two months of 2009. During those five months we lent more than EUR 31 billion, which represents a 38% increase compared with the same period of late-2007/early-2008. In the first area, as regards loans for small and medium-sized enterprises, EUR 5.6 billion in loans were issued in this short period. Several of you have stressed the importance of aiding small and medium-sized enterprises in the current climate. In fact, we are making a very special effort in this area, and I can already tell you that the objective that we were set of releasing EUR 15 billion of these loans during the years 2008 and 2009 will be exceeded.As regards the second objective, energy and the fight against climate change, here too we have made a particular effort, and it is in this context that financing for the automotive industry must be placed. We must be clear: in this sector our funding is going towards projects involving research, development and production of eco-friendly cars, that is, cars that will meet the Union’s new standards regarding the reduction of CO2 emissions.Finally, regarding the third area: aid for countries that have been hardest hit by the crisis: during this same five-month period we issued EUR 910 million in loans in Hungary, EUR 600 million in Latvia, EUR 1 billion in Romania and EUR 1.1 billion in Lithuania.I therefore think that I can say that we have been doing our best to respond to the Member States’ appeal and to implement the agreed measures without delay. Mr Mirow himself has already alluded to the joint International Finance Corporation-European Bank for Reconstruction and Development action plan regarding aid for the banking sector in Central and Eastern Europe.Naturally, this increase in the volume of our loans is only possible thanks to the increase in capital on which our shareholders have decided – it will not cost the Member States anything. However, it was decided that we needed our shareholders’ authorisation to turn our reserves into capital.Several of you have asked questions about monitoring and supervision of the EIB, and I personally think that the question is totally legitimate. When a financial institution grows in such a way, it is normal for there to be concerns about how it is monitored. There is what is already in place, which is not insignificant: there is a certain amount of internal monitoring and, above all, there is external monitoring by an independent audit committee that reports directly to our governors. Moreover, the Treaty of Lisbon makes provision for strengthening this audit committee with the addition of people who have proven experience of banking supervision.Might we go further? I would remind you that the Court of Auditors already monitors all the EIB’s activities whenever these involve the use of funds from the European budget. Should we go further towards a formal system of banking supervision? That is what Mrs Stauner was hoping for. Mr Bullmann pointed out that things were perhaps not that simple. In any event, it is worth discussing. All I can do today is confirm that the EIB is fully open to being subjected to formal banking supervision, if it is considered worthwhile.For the moment, we have organised, alongside the Financial Sector Supervisory Commission in Luxembourg, a form of informal supervision.In answer to Mr Audy, I would say that the action that he requested last year from the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) has indeed been carried out. We have therefore questioned the CEBS, but it informed us that it itself did not have any authority in the area and that it could not even act in an advisory role. We are therefore still in the hands of those who would like to take an initiative in this regard. I say again that we are open to such initiatives.A word in conclusion on cooperation between our two institutions. Mr Mirow has already indicated that it was developing well, particularly in the Western Balkans, and with our neighbours in the East, most recently in Turkey. All I want to say, in order to keep to my speaking time, is that we are in full agreement with the recommendations featured in Mr Mitchell’s report. We think that it would be in the common interest of both our institutions, and of our borrowers too, for us to move towards a more rational and functional division of labour.A word in conclusion on Mr Seppänen’s report. I would like to say how much we have appreciated Mr Seppänen’s constructive approach. He proposes a temporary solution, which allows the EIB to continue with its activities, but which fixes a date for an in-depth discussion of the role that the EIB should play outside the European Union. I am in no doubt that this is a debate on which we will spend some time and that, I believe, has come at just the right moment.

I believe most of the speeches expressed a high level of agreement and consensus on the guidelines that have just been set out by the Presidents of the two banks, at this time of crisis but also of opportunity. By using their resources and actions, they intend to support such essential policies in the European Union as energy efficiency, the fight against climate change, support for small and medium-sized enterprises and support for clean technology in sectors which are very badly affected at the moment, such as the car industry.I believe that there is also very broad agreement on the need to intensify, as far as possible, the actions of both banks in those countries particularly affected or hit by the crisis, both within the European Union and beyond our borders. I agree with all those Members who have asked the banks to do more. I do not agree with the person who told the banks to do less or to be more prudent at this difficult time. I believe, in fact, that the existence of banks such as the European Investment Bank or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is particularly justified at a time like the present.I have a few final words to say on the comments regarding the supervision of the EIB. I am delighted that Mr Maystadt has demonstrated his openness, which in fact I had already seen before, towards reviewing this issue and finding a solution to it, as was previously mentioned in the debate last year.Of course the Commission is ready right now to work together with Mr Maystadt to identify the most effective tools, which at the same time comply with our rules, in order to find a solution to such an important issue, particularly at a time when the EIB and also the EBRD are having to resort to markets where it is more difficult than in previous years to raise finance under favourable conditions and with the highest possible rating with which both banks work.

The comments made by President Maystadt that the EIB’s additional financial support will allow quick disbursements and contribute to the real economy, notably by protecting good projects and helping viable companies in these difficult times, are very encouraging. It is my opinion that we need to support struggling companies as much as possible to provide them with the credit they need to keep their businesses afloat and to ensure that jobs are not lost.The report calls, however, for vigilance with regard to the use made of EIB loans by commercial banks, and for a code of conduct between the commercial banks and the EIB in this respect. I hope Members would note that from some of the comments that were made.Secondly, the current mood in Europe is one of apprehension: housing prices continue to tumble in some countries and people are hoarding their savings. To combat the effect of this crunch, we must begin to talk about the recovery. We took our eye off the ball when it came to the crisis we are in. We are taking our eye off the ball again. Recovery is coming: it may be at the end of this year or it may be next year, but it will come. We need to start talking about recovery and preparing for recovery and, in particular, being competitive enough to take advantage of recovery. I urge that on the three institutions represented here today and on the House.Lastly, there is a need for the EIB and the EBRD to work together with other international and regional financial institutions – such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the African Development Bank – in order to promote development in areas further afield from Europe. These banks have a positive impact in delivering aid to developing countries, but I believe that this impact needs to be properly assessed.The financing of land ownership in developing countries needs to be looked at as an investment cost under the EIB external lending mandate. I have raised this issue on a number of occasions. The country I come from experienced famine. We experienced all sorts of things that people in African countries are now experiencing. What changed the north-eastern part of our island was that people invested in universally small pieces of land.Look at this model for the developing world. We need them as our future trading partners and I urge both banks to consider what I have said here, because I think that is a way to help the developing world. This is an issue raised here today only minutes ago by the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and I commend that particular point to both banks.Thank you, Mr President, for the opportunity to respond to this debate.

The EIB’s role as an EU instrument for supporting economic development is indisputable. The EU has a series of financial instruments in the area of external relations and the EIB's activity must be complementary to them.With regard to the financing priorities, I am pleased that the current version of the report also features my proposal to include a necessary clarification about the energy projects in Eastern Europe and the Southern Caucasus, namely that they must be ‘in line with the objective of Community policy of diversifying energy sources and with a view to guaranteeing stable and secure resources for consumers.’I am pleased that European leaders have reached a compromise within the European Council regarding the financing of energy projects by the EU as part of the Economic Recovery Plan. I am also pleased that the Nabucco project survived this compromise and that it has been declared a priority energy project.

The EU has a series of financial instruments in the area of external relations and the EIB's activity must be complementary to them."", 'With regard to the financing priorities, I am pleased that the current version of the report also features my proposal to include a necessary clarification about the energy projects in Eastern Europe and the Southern Caucasus, namely that they must be ‘in line with the objective of Community policy of diversifying energy sources and with a view to guaranteeing stable and secure resources for consumers.’', 'I am pleased that European leaders have reached a compromise within the European Council regarding the financing of energy projects by the EU as part of the Economic Recovery Plan.

348, 10. The ABB-ABM method as a management tool for allocating budgetary resources - Mid-term Review of the 2007-2013 Financial Framework (debate) ,"  Kyösti Virrankoski,  rapporteur. − (FI) Mr President, before us is the report on Activity Based Budgeting and Management. I would like to thank the entire Committee on Budgets for its robust and consistent support, as well as the Committee Secretariat and all those who assisted me.Activity Based Budgeting (ABB) and Activity Based Management (ABM) were introduced during the Prodi Commission, spearheaded by Commissioner Kinnock. The stimulus for reform was provided by the report by an external group of experts that was commissioned to look into the crisis the previous Commission was going through. This report represents a sort of mid-stage review of what is referred to as the ‘Kinnock reforms’.The aim of ABB and ABM is to clarify administration by budgeting available resources and human resources according to policy area. Administration should be able to show the results achieved clearly in order to make their value compared to input clearly visible.The main focus is results and not so much how they have been achieved. The approach reflects that used in business.The system can also be expressed more simply. It is not enough that money is spent – or even ‘blown’ – legally or in accordance with the rules: the results determine the quality of administration, not good intentions.The results also show how efficient management and administration are. Let us take the structural and cohesion policy as an example. If, two years and three months after the programming period starts, over three-quarters of the administration and control systems have not been adopted, administration cannot be regarded as being efficient. It may be the fault of both the Commission and the Member States, though the fact remains that the administration is bureaucratic and inefficient.ABB and ABM put the emphasis on and promote efficiency. They reduce bureaucracy and strengthen the legal status of citizens and those affected by the administration affects, as regards management.Activity Based Management puts the emphasis on personal responsibility, but it also allows for freedom of action. With a good administrative system there is a clear division of responsibility. Management has a face, at both the lower and the upper level.Because the goal of management is good productivity, a manager should not put unnecessary constraints on work. Only essential regulations are necessary. There is no need for inessential reports and planning.This report is based on recent studies, the most important of which are listed in the explanatory statement section. Their general tone suggests that the implementation of ABB and ABM has been a success and has brought about a major cultural change in the Commission whilst at the same time helping to clarify personal responsibilities and accountability, and making management more effective, result-oriented and transparent.Bureaucracy and the fact that it is on the increase, however, are a real danger. We particularly need to assess whether the current annual Planning and Review Process involves too much planning, especially in comparison to the presentation and evaluation of the results achieved.We should also examine how the five-year strategic objectives of the Commission, its ‘Government Programme’, are linked to the multiannual financial frameworks (MFF) and, moreover, to the Annual Policy Strategy. The Annual Policy Strategy is often associated with elements that have no obvious connection with the Government Programme, the five-year strategic objectives or the multiannual financial framework. This generally causes problems for the drafting of the budget, as resources are included in the revision of the financial framework, which is what the Council objects to in particular. There have been clear examples of this virtually every five years.The Commission has particular difficulties determining the ‘negative priorities’, to wit, the activities that are unnecessary or less important and which should be abandoned. It is to be hoped, in this respect, that the Commission will be bolder in its approach.It is still hard to estimate administrative expenditure, although this is budgeted separately, because administration is still financed from functional appropriations, and that includes executive agencies and, frequently, technical assistance in Member States. That is why the report gives attention to the importance of monitoring human resources.Finally, Mr President, the report before us is based on our European heritage – Article 15 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen of the great French Revolution of 1789: ‘Society has the right to ask a public official for an accounting of his administration.’.

349, 10. The ABB-ABM method as a management tool for allocating budgetary resources - Mid-term Review of the 2007-2013 Financial Framework (debate) ,"  Reimer Böge,  rapporteur. – (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the mid-term review of the 2007-2013 Financial Framework. I would like to remind you once again that we originally agreed on a series of interinstitutional declarations which this report calls to be implemented and which we are handing over to the newly elected Parliament in the form of guidelines for the future conduct of the European Parliament in its debates over the next few months.There were three main declarations which required Parliament to be included in future discussions of revenue and spending policy, in a way which has never been the case in the past. Therefore, the Commission undertook to present a report on the functioning of the Interinstitutional Agreement at the end of 2009. The Commission also undertook to present a full, wide-ranging budget review covering all aspects of EU spending, including the common agricultural policy, and of resources, including the United Kingdom rebate, in 2008/2009. In addition, we must not forget that a mid-term review of many of the multiannual programmes will take place in this House in 2010.Anyone who looks at the papers from the public consultation will see that the Member States, in contrast to the other bodies which expressed an opinion, are attempting to shirk their responsibilities and the undertaking they have entered into by moving directly to the subsequent Financial Perspective. I have just come from a discussion on the so-called Economic Recovery Plan, and I would like to say that what is happening here, with the constant search for margins which are no longer available, and with new plans which infringe on the budgetary rights of Parliament, makes it clear that we cannot go on as before. This is why I am calling on the Commission to present a proposal in the autumn which will not only cover the period after 2013, but will also include a review of the Financial Perspective and open up new prospects for the future.We state quite clearly in this report that we will focus first of all on existing deficits and the long-term outlook, without dealing in detail with the budgetary impact of the Lisbon Reform Treaty. For this reason, in the Committee on Budgets we have voted with a large majority in favour of a three-step approach: resolution of the shortcomings and obvious deficits in the outstanding issues that we have not been able to negotiate successfully and clarification that there are budget headings – the main areas of emphasis of our policies – which are chronically under-funded. For example, we will not achieve our objectives in research and innovation. In the areas of headings 3a and 3b we will not be able to achieve what we wanted to with regard to culture, youth, education and ensuring our internal and external security. The Common Foreign and Security Policy is also chronically under-funded.This is why we have made the following offer to the Council: let us discuss these shortcomings and hold negotiations in this area, but not as part of the struggle over the annual budgetary procedure. Our proposal is to resolve these problems in an ambitious review and, at the same time, to extend the existing Financial Perspective until 2015 or even 2016, so that in the long term we achieve the necessary democratic legitimacy in the financial framework. This will involve bringing the term of office of the Commission and the period covered by the financial framework more closely into line with one another. In addition, we must not forget, in particular in the context of the debate on the European Investment Bank, to ensure that there are no shadow budgets outside the Community budget.I would like to conclude by saying that this report is in agreement with the reports produced by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. This is why we are giving the following message to the Commission and the Council: for us the objective of achieving a five-year financial framework which runs in parallel with the term of office of the Commission is not negotiable.

354, 10. The ABB-ABM method as a management tool for allocating budgetary resources - Mid-term Review of the 2007-2013 Financial Framework (debate) ,"  Rumiana Jeleva,  draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. – (BG) Ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Development, I would like to emphasise the importance of the mid-term review of the 2007-2013 Financial Framework.I welcome Mr Böge’s report because it also indicates areas where changes and improvements are needed, thereby paving the way for a more efficient European Union. From my committee’s point of view, we are mainly interested in how cohesion policy resources are spent, as this is one of the fundamental parts of the budget. We maintain our long-term stance that the majority of financial resources must be targeted at the less developed regions which require the EU’s support. I am pleased that the report does not conflict with our stance on this issue.There are new global challenges present with a significant territorial impact. In order to overcome them, sufficient funding must be guaranteed for the period beyond 2013. 0.35% of the EU’s GDP may not be sufficient to achieve our objectives. We regret that the report does not fully take on board our suggestion, but we welcome the fact that it reaches a conclusion which is very close to ours.We also reviewed the status of the Structural Funds where, unfortunately, there is a low level of use of resources in some countries. National authorities are guilty to a certain degree of using them ineffectively in their work. I believe that the complexity of the system is also one of the reasons for the low levels of use.

From my committee’s point of view, we are mainly interested in how cohesion policy resources are spent, as this is one of the fundamental parts of the budget. We maintain our long-term stance that the majority of financial resources must be targeted at the less developed regions which require the EU’s support. I am pleased that the report does not conflict with our stance on this issue.', 'There are new global challenges present with a significant territorial impact. In order to overcome them, sufficient funding must be guaranteed for the period beyond 2013. 0.35% of the EU’s GDP may not be sufficient to achieve our objectives. We regret that the report does not fully take on board our suggestion, but we welcome the fact that it reaches a conclusion which is very close to ours.', 'We also reviewed the status of the Structural Funds where, unfortunately, there is a low level of use of resources in some countries. National authorities are guilty to a certain degree of using them ineffectively in their work. I believe that the complexity of the system is also one of the reasons for the low levels of use. Our committee suggested simplifying the procedures and I am pleased that Mr Böge’s report follows a similar line of thought.', 'Our committee believes that we need to initiate the debate again on the spending of the resources which we are losing due to the N+2/N+3 rule.

This surprises me a little, as necessary undertakings in relation to the budget were made last weekend and then, when it comes to debating the specific funding of those undertakings, the Council cries off.I stand here, in any case, with the requisite sense of irony. Officially, we are here to debate the mid-term review, but in reality everything required has already been said about the economic stimulus package about which a deal was reached last weekend. That package sets out where the mid-term review and the multiannual budget fall short as, since the beginning of the current multiannual framework, we have on three occasions in a row tampered with our own deals. Galileo, the food aid for Africa and the way that that is funded were no things of beauty.Now, once again, we have the debate about the economic stimulus package. The Council has given undertakings but does not seem to know yet where the money is going to come from. In the field of energy, for instance, just 2 billion or so has to be found for energy projects, not only from this year’s budget, but also from next year’s budget and possibly the one from the year after that. That means that we will already be groping around in the margins of the agricultural budget. In doing so, people will say, well, it is not agricultural money, it is the margin, but there only has to be one animal disease outbreak and that money actually will be needed within the agricultural budget. Maybe you remember the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease? Or what happens if the poor prices on the dairy market continue and intervention is required? Furthermore, the margin on the agricultural budget is only going to get smaller over the next few years. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s report for the mid-term review quite rightly points that out.I would therefore like the Commission and the Council – should the latter put in an appearance, or, failing that, in writing – to confirm that we will first be looking into the existing obligations in relation to agriculture before moving on to looking at what the margin is, and only then seeing whether that margin can indeed be put to use for other purposes. These are the rules that we have agreed with one another. If we do not stick to them, I think we would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

Thank you very much, Mr Virrankoski, for your hard work.We believe it is important that our budget priorities are also reflected in the issue of human resources.

Too much is left in the budget because we cannot change things because of the restrictions of the MFF.If I could turn to activity-based budgeting and management, I think the Commission has made huge progress on this but I would warn against over-bureaucratising this exercise because what we want to ensure is a qualitative evaluation, not simply ticking boxes. We do not want people spending all their time evaluating themselves when they should be getting on and doing some work. So we have got to be careful about that.

We need a fair, simple, transparent, reliable and sustainable revenue and spending system for the EU.

In this case, the Member States should contribute a maximum of 1% of their GNI.Instead of making more money available for the EU, the funds should be redeployed to areas where genuine added value can be obtained on a European level, for example common foreign policy, trans-European networks, management of external borders and research.

We denounced it at the time and can now clearly see how inadequate this agreement is. Regrettably, the current Financial Perspective has demonstrated its limitations just at the worst moment, just at a time of crisis when the Community budget should have been acting as the spearhead for the European Union in the fight against the economic crisis and unemployment.At the moment it would be an almost amazing feat to find EUR 5 billion in the Community budget to be used in the next two financial years in order to relaunch energy research, ensure energy interconnections or improve communications in the rural areas of the EU. Entire regions of the European Union, such as mine, Asturias, are hoping to find a viable and sustainable way of using coal as a clean energy source.This, for example, is what the Community budget should be used for. However, its inflexibility and the under-funding of the various expenditure headings will only allow this EUR 5 billion to be found if the money for the common agricultural policy for the 2009-2010 period is not fully used.

The ABB-ABM method as a management tool for allocating budgetary resources - Mid-term Review of the 2007-2013 Financial Framework (debate) ,"  Göran Färm  (PSE). -  (SV) Mr President, as the shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament with regard to this matter, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Böge for his positive spirit of cooperation. A long-term framework is important, but a seven-year freeze with rigid budget ceilings both overall and by sector is an unreasonable model in today’s rapidly changing world.The current long-term budget, which is valid until 2014, was, in fact, determined in 2005. What could we have known then of the current economic crisis, of the situation in Kosovo or Gaza, of the extent of the climate crisis or the extreme oscillations in food prices? No, we cannot carry on doing things this way.My conclusion is that we must have a detailed overview of the current long-term budget: the multiannual financial framework. This will apply to a particularly large extent, of course, if the proposal of the Committee on Budgets is implemented, in other words, the extension of the current financial framework by the suggested two years in order to synchronise it better with the Commission’s and Parliament’s terms of office.So what do we want? Several things, in fact.Firstly, our aspirations for the budget review itself. In our view, it is unacceptable to focus only on the forthcoming financial framework. The Committee on Budgets has adopted a number of amendments which mean that we will require the Commission to submit a proposal for a sound review of the content of the current long-term budget as early as possible. This is particularly relevant, of course, if our demand for an extension should be implemented.We also demand that the Swedish Presidency this autumn processes this proposal from the Commission actively and promptly. We must get to grips with this.Secondly, as regards the political approach, we have received clear signals from the broad open consultation that the Commission has carried out. There are a few areas in particular where the EU must be more forceful. These include climate policy; jobs and growth; and foreign and development policy. If the EU is to be capable of playing a global leading role in these areas, it needs resources. This is absolutely clear. Currently, all of these areas are significantly under-funded.Thirdly, we need to make a number of necessary technical changes. I do not need to elaborate on this, as Mr Böge has already talked about it. We want to have five years instead of seven and an adjustment to the period so that the new Parliament and a new Commission can have real influence over the framework that is to apply during their term of office.Fourthly, we want a revised and fairer system for the EU’s own resources. What we need now are rapid proposals and a sound mid-term review of the current long-term budget to bring rhetoric and resources closer to one another and to begin the process towards a more long-term sustainable approach to the EU budget prior to the next long-term budget period.

I should mention that some regions of Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece are receiving such transitional funding during the current Financial Perspective.There also needs to be a final decision on a retreat from the latest attempts to re-nationalise the common agricultural policy. It will not be possible to guarantee mandatory cofinancing of the CAP at similar levels by individual Member States, as this will result in competition being significantly skewed, or in other words the disintegration of the CAP.Regarding the European Commission’s ambition to separate direct payments from production, it is also necessary to remove the great disparities in support for farmland of less than one hectare which currently exist between the old and new Member States after 2013.

It appears to me that the unanimous adoption of Mr Böge’s report to the Committee on Budgets shows that he has found the common denominator in the views of various political groups.What strikes me is the fact that almost EUR 5 billion from the 2008 budget remained unused. This must not be repeated. It would be a failure for all of us. There are initiatives by the Commission aimed at making it easier to obtain funding. As that is how things are and should be, regional policy will not and cannot in future be a source of funding for those sections of the budget that are chronically under-funded: we spoke of this when negotiating the Financial Perspective, and this has been fully corroborated in our foreign policy: heading 1a and heading 3.

When introducing changes to the present budget and when planning the next Financial Perspective, we should be guided above all by an aspiration to deepen integration and achieve specific objectives.Recently we have been able to observe far-reaching changes in the structure of the EU budget. Expenditure on the CAP no longer uses up the largest part of the Community’s cash. Currently cohesion policy and measures connected with realisation of the Lisbon Strategy can count on the greatest support. There is no doubt that this evolution is beneficial to the future of a Europe oriented towards an innovative, knowledge-based economy which guarantees a high level of employment. However, such a change must not take place at the cost of undermining European food security and reducing the incomes of farmers.Equally disturbing is the advancing reduction in the level of the EU budget in relation to the GNI of EU Member States. Statistics show that if in the current Perspective we had maintained the budget at the level it was in the period 1993–1999 (calculated according to the same percentage of GDP), we would have an additional EUR 200 billion available for the realisation of European policies. The pressure which we observe to reduce the Community budget is harmful, because this limits its flexibility and its ability to adapt to changing needs. Therefore I appeal for adaptation of the EU budget to new challenges not to be made by moving resources from the CAP, but by an appropriate increase in EU budgetary means.

The pressure which we observe to reduce the Community budget is harmful, because this limits its flexibility and its ability to adapt to changing needs. Therefore I appeal for adaptation of the EU budget to new challenges not to be made by moving resources from the CAP, but by an appropriate increase in EU budgetary means. ']"

377, 11. Future of the car industry (debate) ,"  Günter Verheugen,  Vice-President of the Commission. − (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is now the second occasion in just a few months on which we have come together in the Chamber to discuss the situation of the car industry in Europe. Regretfully, I have to say that the situation has worsened since our last debate.In the last quarter of 2008, sales of new cars fell by 20% and car production by 29%. This negative trend is continuing in 2009. In January and February of this year, the sales figures dropped by 29% and 18% respectively. The fall would have been larger, if some Member States had not launched successful initiatives to stimulate demand. The crisis is not restricted to the European market. Exports to third countries have been reducing rapidly which means that we can expect a negative impact on the European balance of trade. Throughout the world the car industry is under pressure.There is no prospect of improvement in the remaining months of this year. Overall production of cars and commercial vehicles in Europe is likely to fall by between 20-30%. This means that around 5 million fewer vehicles will be produced in Europe in 2009 than in 2007. The negative forecast applies in particular to commercial vehicles where a fall in production of 35% is expected.As you know, the Commission has responded quickly to this situation. In October 2008, we made the first recommendations in the CARS 21 group for overcoming the crisis, including the involvement of the European Investment Bank and the scrappage incentives. At the beginning of January I met with EU finance ministers to agree on a common approach to the crisis. On 25 February the Commission presented a concept which was approved a few days later by the European Council and the Competitiveness Council.Our responses are aimed directly at the most important causes of this very severe crisis. These causes include rapidly falling demand, difficulty in accessing capital, liquidity problems and structural overcapacity. In the case of structural overcapacity, this is a worldwide phenomenon. What we want to do now is to maintain the integrity of the European internal market, avoid protectionism and preserve the solidarity of the Member States, in order to save jobs in the car industry.I would like to state very clearly at this point that the industry itself must make the first moves. Within CARS 21 we have established the basic conditions for a forward-looking car industry and are constantly improving them. To be quite clear about this, the European car industry must now make efforts across a broad front to bring the types of cars onto the market which we need at the start of the 21st century, in other words, energy-efficient cars with low fuel consumption, which make careful use of resources.On the political side, the Commission has made its position clear. In our opinion, the most important task is to enable the financial system to function effectively once again, so that the high level of investment needed by the European car industry can be provided. This high level of investment is necessary because the industry must develop and bring onto the market the European car of the future.We have adopted the Temporary Community Framework for State aid, which gives the Member States more room for manoeuvre in solving liquidity problems. This was a necessary step to ensure that otherwise profitable companies did not fall victim to the acute effects of the crisis.In addition, we wanted to ensure that companies continued to invest in research and modernisation, in particular during the crisis. We have made good progress with the measures that we have taken. This year the European Investment Bank has already approved projects for the car industry with a value of more than EUR 3 billion. Further projects with a total value of several billion euro are already being planned for 2009. These projects involve not only car manufacturers, but also suppliers to the car industry.The European Investment Bank, which I would like to thank very much for its cooperation, is also working on a special programme for the medium-sized companies in the automotive supply industry which have been particularly hard hit by the crisis. We will be making EUR 1 billion available for a research partnership with industry in order to accelerate the move to a low-carbon, energy-efficient economy. This is needed in order to put European industry in a good position for the period after the crisis, so that it can really benefit from the positive development which we are expecting then.We can also do something on the demand side. A number of Member States have introduced scrappage incentives to stimulate demand. The Commission has laid down guidelines which the Member States must follow for the introduction of incentive programmes of this kind. This is aimed at ensuring that national measures do not have a discriminatory effect or interfere with the internal market. I am pleased to be able to tell you that this has been successful.Of course, we also need to cushion ourselves from the effects of structural change, keep social costs to a minimum and retain skilled workers in the car industry. If the European automotive industry wants to remain competitive in the long term, some structural changes will be unavoidable. The process will be painful, but it is inevitable. We need a vigorous, competitive industry with significant employment potential, not companies which are permanently dependent on subsidies. The European Commission has made money available from the European Social Fund and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to support workers who are hardest hit by the temporary effects of the essential restructuring of the industry.In April we will hold our first round table with representatives of the industry, the workforce and the Member States in order to discuss the social dimension of the crisis and our response to it. However, I would advise companies to provide vocational training now for their employees in order to improve their chances of finding jobs either in the car industry or in other sectors of the economy.I would like to say something about the situation of a specific manufacturer, General Motors in Europe, which is made up of Opel, Vauxhall and Saab. I would like to repeat at this point that it is not in the interests of Europe to allow this company to go under. More than 200 000 jobs throughout Europe are dependent on the company. I am not of the opinion that the disappearance of General Motors production sites in Europe would help to solve the capacity problem in the European car industry and is therefore to be welcomed. The workers who are affected are not responsible for the crisis within their company. The crisis comes only from America.There is no national solution to this problem. There is not even a European solution. There can only be a transatlantic solution which involves the parent company. Therefore, it is important for us to know what will happen in the United States. At the moment we do not know. Even the American Government does not yet know. I am pleased that all the European governments with General Motors sites in their countries have agreed not to go it alone, but instead to work together on the European part of the solution. The result of this solution can only be a successor company which is competitive and can survive on the market. In addition, it must be possible to provide economic as well as political justification for the solution. The jobs at General Motors in Europe are too important to allow them to be dragged into elections or the politics of national interest. This is why the Commission will continue to make every effort to find a European solution of this kind.Finally, the Commission will also ensure that it does not impose any additional financial burdens that could be avoided on the car industry at this difficult time as part of its legislative programme.The time for talking about the severity of the crisis has passed. We have in place a European plan with coordinated measures both at EU and at Member State level. It is now time to act and to implement these plans in full. Thank you very much.

378, 11. Future of the car industry (debate) ,"  Werner Langen,  on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. – (DE) Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Verheugen very much for bringing up this subject and to congratulate him on his success in coordinating the European measures and preventing individual Member States from going it alone during a meeting of ministers on 13 March.We have requested a debate on the basis of your written report because we believe that the crisis is so serious that the European Parliament must discuss it. We have drawn up a joint resolution which covers the most important points.I would like to repeat some of what you have said. Of course, the rescue of an individual company can only be successful by taking into account the company’s own responsibility – and the special circumstances of the General Motors case – together with the intellectual property rights and many other factors. Overall it is a very large industry. With a total of 12 million jobs dependent on the car industry, annual investments of EUR 20 billion, an annual turnover of EUR 780 billion and added value of EUR 140 billion, it is a very important industry, which has got into difficulties partly through its own fault – I am thinking here of the overcapacity and the model policies of some manufacturers – but in general terms mainly because of the effects of the international crisis on the financial markets.Therefore, we welcome the fact that all these collective measures are being taken. They should help to ensure that the car industry is more sustainable, to stimulate demand so that the industry can emerge from the crisis and to make it easier to provide investment and finance for buyers and for the industry. In addition, these measures, as you said at the end of your speech, should not bring about new legislative problems which would apply additional pressure to the competitiveness of the European car industry.On this basis we can adopt the joint resolution. My group will vote in favour of the amendment from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament on paragraph 5, to refer specifically to the special case of General Motors, so that with a broad majority we can encourage the Commission to offer workers job security and to open up new prospects for the car industry.

This crisis has hit one of our key industries very hard. A total of 12 million jobs, 6% of the work force, the largest investor in research and development – this makes discussing the problem and finding solutions very much worthwhile. However, it has now become clear that the EU does not have suitable instruments available to deal with this crisis. The Member States are pressing ahead individually, the framework for competition has at times been put at risk and the European Investment Bank, the universal cure-all, is overstretched both in terms of its finances and its staff. Therefore, we need to find new approaches.I am grateful to Commissioner Verheugen for adopting this framework directive very quickly in order to investigate how we should proceed in the context of competition law. However, the EIB needs to be better equipped. The EIB needs to be offered special conditions by the European Central Bank to allow it access to fresh capital, which is not currently permitted by law. It is also important that state aid is more closely linked to the paradigm shift towards new technologies and away from the internal combustion engine. In addition, funds, such as the Structural Funds and the agricultural funds, should be focused on developing stronger infrastructures for these new technologies.I would like to look more closely at General Motors. I agree with the Commissioner and the previous speakers that this has a European dimension, because the company has sites in many of the Member States of the EU. The bottom line, however, is that the state, including the EU, should not intervene in the economy. The crisis has not changed this principle. Although the car industry is a strategic sector, it is not systemic in the same way as the banking industry. Therefore, we should avoid taking shareholdings in the car industry. However, I believe that guarantees are the right approach, if there is a private investor to take on a guarantee via the EIB. This assumes that we are following the paradigm shift and moving into new technologies.

In addition, it must be conditional on these companies genuinely focusing on innovation.Something which makes me a little suspicious, Commissioner, is the considerable influence of the CARS 21 group and the influence of the industry in the process which is being kick-started here.

383, 11. Future of the car industry (debate) ,"  Roberto Musacchio,  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. – (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on the car industry is unfortunately too late in the day and also inadequate in content. In fact we are debating when decisions have already been made by the national governments outside any real European framework, and there have already been tragic social consequences in terms of unemployment and unemployment benefit.Staying on this subject, the text of the resolution does not propose any fundamental elements for ensuring that the measures to be taken are effective and fair. I should like to point out that, a few months ago, when dealing with climate change, Europe acted very differently, treating it as a real political issue.

384, 11. Future of the car industry (debate) ,"  Sergej Kozlík  (NI).  – (SK) The dramatic fall in global demand for cars has also affected Europe. In the final quarter of 2008, European car sales showed an annual decline of over 19% and they are still falling. Many of the key Member States of the European Union have decided to support the vehicle-manufacturing sector. However, doubts are appearing concerning the approaches that have been selected and drawn up, as they smell of protectionism. I therefore support the standpoint of the European Commission which is warning against protectionist measures in support of domestic producers. The call made by the Commission to resolve structural problems as a matter of priority is to the point, especially with regard to high overproduction and investments in innovative technologies.All public sector support must be transparent and it must respect EU rules on competition and state aid. We must prevent rivalry over subsidies between the various players on the European market. The situation is made more difficult by the fact that these rules do not take account of global competition, particularly from the US. It is expected that US subsidies for resolving the problems of car producers will be extended to parts suppliers as well. If the situation becomes acute, Europe may face not only the issue of how to sort out production and sales problems in Europe, but also the problem of imported cars that have been produced with excessive state aid. In such a situation Europe could also threaten to enforce measures within a World Trade Organization framework.Many European countries have introduced scrappage schemes and efforts in this direction have now begun in the UK. However, scrappage schemes can resolve the crisis only in the short-term. They quickly deform markets, drain money from the public purse and cause the postponement of necessary solutions that focus on investment in innovative technologies.

We really want Europe, all of us together, to do much more for the future of our car companies. We, as the European Union, have a unique opportunity here to show that we are on the side of the workers – of the 200 000 Opel workers in Germany, Poland, Austria, Spain and Belgium, to name just a few.For that reason, quite specifically, the European Investment Bank must release credit and exploit its leverage functions and potential to the maximum extent. Two weeks ago, we had a consultation with the upper echelons of the sector here in Parliament and it became clear that there is one huge problem: the sector is suffering from an acute shortage of capital. That is why cheap loans and state guarantees are absolutely necessary, not only for survival, but above all in order to unflinchingly make the switchover to the car of the future, a car which is to be electric, hybrid and, most importantly, environmentally friendly, and which is ready to go into production.The social partners, and certainly the employees’ representatives, must be closely involved in this European recovery plan, as this issue is also a litmus test for social dialogue at European level.Commissioner Verheugen, it is not too late for action.

I believe that it is very important and also a very important signal to the workers in the car industry who are at the centre of this debate. This is only right and proper.Some Members, including Mrs Harms, Mr Hökmark and others, have looked at the question of the link between innovation and competitiveness. Once again I would like to emphasise very clearly that without this link with innovation the European car industry will not be competitive in the long term. The goal of our policy is to ensure that the European car of the future is the most innovative, in other words, the cleanest, most energy-efficient and safest, in the world. I have confidence that our manufacturers, our technical specialists and our engineers can achieve this. We have the potential to achieve this.I would like to move on to a second subject, in other words, financing in the crisis. The banks are not providing funds. Companies are not able to obtain the loans that they need. The European Investment Bank is now our all-purpose tool. I must state quite clearly that the European Investment Bank has already reached the limits of what it is able to do. The car industry is not the only sector which we are asking the EIB to help with. What about finance for small and medium-sized enterprises? What about finance for our highly ambitious climate-protection objectives? All of this is being provided by the EIB. I know now that we will receive requests from industry which the EIB simply will not be able to respond to, because we want it to do business on a sound basis and not to create bubbles, as others have done. Therefore, the problems are likely to increase in the second half of the year and we must prepare for this to happen.I also support everyone who has said that we need intelligent incentives to ensure that all the cars which we want to come onto the market are actually bought. I very much share Mr Groote’s opinion on CO2-based vehicle tax. The Commission proposed this a long time ago and I am very sad that some Member States did not follow this proposal at the time.Mrs De Vits spoke about the role of the trade unions and the works councils. I am very pleased to be able to inform you that the last detailed discussion which I had before coming to this session was with the Chairman of the works council of General Motors in Europe. We are in constant, regular contact and exchange all the information that we have. I must say that until now I have benefited more from this exchange of information than the Chairman of the works council. I find out more from him than he does from me. However, I hope to be able to return the favour in future. In a few days, we will be meeting with the European metal-working unions and automotive unions and, of course, the unions are the main parties involved in the round-table meetings, which I have already mentioned. Therefore, I believe that we have met all the requirements.In the ‘catch-the-eye’ procedure there were several references to scrappage incentives. We do need to ask ourselves whether this will really help in the long term. It could also be the case that we are creating artificial demand which will lead to another collapse. Nevertheless, all the manufacturers were impressed by this idea because it will help them through the very difficult phase which they are in at the moment. It is like a supply of oxygen and it has helped significantly to ensure that there have as yet been no mass redundancies among the major manufacturers in Europe and that they have been able to retain their workforces. In this respect, I believe that it has fulfilled its purpose.The scrappage incentive is a standard European initiative, in the sense that clear rules are in place which everyone has observed. It goes without saying that we cannot finance the incentive from the Community budget. The budget is not intended for this purpose and this would not be possible either in political or legal terms. The incentives have also had a positive cross-border impact. Mrs Roithová, your country in particular has benefited very much from the generous incentive schemes in other European Member States. There is a certain amount of European solidarity involved here, which should not be underestimated.I have seen this debate as a call to continue to take action on this issue and to stay on the ball.

It is actually the legislator’s response to the need to harmonise and make European airspace and air traffic more efficient for the benefit of the environment, industry and, first and foremost, passengers.The agreement reached with the Council on the SES II package is a step forward for us on the road to consolidating the European Union. This is the next natural step after a common market, adopting a single currency and creating the Schengen area. From 2012 we will have a Schengen airspace. Routes will be shorter, traffic control more efficient and air navigation services will be optimised and, in the future, integrated.As a result, flights will be shorter, less fuel will be used and carbon dioxide emissions will be lower, which should normally lead to a reduction in airline ticket prices.The compromise reached following the negotiations with the Council reflects the need to speed up the formation of functional airspace blocks. We have reached agreement on a deadline for putting FABs into operation, which is six months ahead of the European Commission’s initial proposal.The operation of FABs is the main element in creating a single European sky. This is why I welcome the agreement signed in November last year for the largest FAB, which covers Central Europe.I would like to take this opportunity to call on the European Commission’s support in approving the project linked to the Danube Romania-Bulgaria FAB as part of the TEN-T financial framework.With the support of the representatives of the French and Czech Presidencies, whom I would like to take this opportunity to thank, we successfully managed to balance the decision-making relations and skills between the Member States and European Commission, particularly with regard to the performance scheme, a key element in the SES II package.The Commission will make the decision concerning the proper harmonisation and implementation of the targets covered in the national performance plans.The Commission’s initial proposal has been supplemented by two elements introduced by Parliament. The first of these is the Functional Airspace Block System Coordinator. We considered it necessary, based on the TEN-T model, to appoint a coordinator to facilitate the signing of FAB operation agreements, thereby accelerating the process of achieving a single European sky. The second element relates to the clarification of the ‘common projects’ concept and the definition of the financing sources relating to them.The European Parliament also managed to have special attention focused on the human factor. The compromise reached with the Council also clarifies the interdependencies between SES II and EASA, bearing in mind that extending the Agency’s powers at aerodromes, ATM/ANS and ATC is actually the ‘safety’ element in the package.I think that it is extremely important for a clear, complete definition to be found for aerodromes which come under the provisions of this regulation.The new specifications issued by EASA must integrate with the existing ones. In addition, the opportunity has been given to mention the derogations granted so far.

The performance and sustainability of the European aviation system - Aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services (debate) ","  Antonio Tajani,  Vice-President of the Commission. − (IT) Madam President, honourable Members, on the eve of the European elections and two weeks away from the adoption of the third maritime package, the European institutions are about to send another positive signal to EU citizens, demonstrating that, at this time of crisis in particular, the Commission, Parliament and the Council are on the side of the citizens, are capable of tackling a difficult crisis and are capable of providing practical answers.The single European sky reform is an important signal that will have consequences for industry and for citizens and that will reduce environmental pollution. The data that we have on the difficulties being faced by the air transport sector are well known – other data have arrived today and I shall list them during my answer – and therefore we have shown that we can react to a crisis, and this is definitely a positive thing, as it makes Europeans realise that the institutions exist and that they are capable of facing up to difficulties.For this reason I should like to thank Parliament for the speed with which it has adopted this decision. I am grateful to Mr Marinescu, with whom I have a long-standing friendship forged by our working together, side by side, in Parliament – I know his abilities, which he has been able to show once again by working alongside the Commission and producing an important result in a very short amount of time – and, with him, I should also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs, who have enabled the institutions once again to support the people of Europe.This has certainly been a major commitment and one that, I repeat, constitutes an effective response. Air transport is in fact waiting for practical and tangible measures that will enable the requirements not only of carriers, but above all of passengers, to be met. To this end I have insisted on the introduction of a service regulator, to ensure that monopolies do not hinder service quality. Furthermore, the swift introduction of an air traffic network manager, in addition to facilitating the deployment of national systems, may set an example for all modes of transport, but also for the telecommunication and energy sectors.I should like to point out the support offered by Parliament to the Commission with regard to the development of a new instrument for financing cross-border infrastructure projects, stemming from, among other things, the SESAR programme. Parliament has understood the importance of the partnership and has reaffirmed the important role performed by operators in terms of implementing this ambitious approach.I am pleased to see Parliament joining with the Commission in recognising, through a joint declaration, the importance to be attached to the human factor. In particular, Parliament has given its backing to strengthening the position of the military through the creation of the single sky, and this is a position that I fully support, not least because, for a time, I was a military air defence controller, and so I cannot fail to understand the important role that military controllers perform in the air traffic sector. I would cite, by way of example, operations rooms that I have visited, where civilian operators and military operators work side by side to guarantee the safety of air transport.The joint declaration, which I support, stipulates that the Commission must affirm the need to take human factors duly into account in order effectively to implement the single European sky regulations, must be convinced that safety can never be taken for granted and must recognise the need to further strengthen the culture of safety, in particular by integrating a reliable accident alerting and just culture system, so as to learn from accidents that take place.The Commission declares that it will build the service model on the basis of a genuine culture of safety, integrating an effective accident alerting and just culture system as a basis for safety provision. It will ensure that professionals responsible for guaranteeing safety have a sufficient level of skill, and it will promote the involvement of staff representatives in the creation of the single European sky at national, functional-airspace-block and Community level. It will assess the integration of human factors in the creation of the single European sky no later than 2012.To conclude, for the first time every aspect of the entire aviation sector will be dealt with. Thanks to this new approach, safety of movements on the ground in airports, in air corridors and during landing and take-off will be handled by a single body.This is therefore the start of a new phase for the Aviation Safety Agency. Such a swift adoption of the package – and I thank you once again – demonstrates the strong political will that exists at European level to realise the great ideas of an important predecessor of mine, who is sadly no longer with us: Loyola De Palacio.

This second package of legislation will allow us to manage our airspace more efficiently in the years to come. It will also enable the airlines and in the end the consumers to save up to EUR 3 billion and to cut CO2 emissions by up to 12%. These are important objectives in terms of costs, the consumer and the environment, which are now within our grasp.In the first of the two regulations, the Member States undertake finally to do what they should have done years ago, which is to establish functional airspace blocks within a short time. These blocks of airspace, which are no longer divided up along national boundaries, but instead according to functional flows of air traffic, will allow airspace to be managed more efficiently and more safely and will help to prevent unnecessary holding stacks in the sky.I am very grateful for the Commission’s support and for the rapporteur’s determination to appoint a European coordinator for the functional airspace blocks, because we will have problems in ensuring that the Member States really do establish these new blocks. It is important that a coordinator working on behalf of Parliament and the Commission will be able to press for these new blocks to be created.It is also important that military airspace management is integrated into this system and that we have a genuine master plan for the single European sky, which applies and implements the technological results of the air traffic control research project SESAR.

416," 12. The performance and sustainability of the European aviation system - Aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services (debate) ","  Ulrich Stockmann,  on behalf of the PSE Group. – (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I know of a song which contains the line ‘There must be unlimited freedom in the sky’. This is simply not true. The European sky consists of a patchwork of 60 national control centres. This is twice as many as in the USA, but with half the amount of air traffic. In addition, military no-fly zones prevent planes from flying in a straight line from one airport to another. This is not sustainable, particularly in the light of the fact that the volume of air traffic doubles every 10 to 15 years. When the amount of traffic doubles, the safety risk increases fourfold.This led us in 2004 to initiate the single European sky concept.

This is simply not true. The European sky consists of a patchwork of 60 national control centres. This is twice as many as in the USA, but with half the amount of air traffic. In addition, military no-fly zones prevent planes from flying in a straight line from one airport to another. This is not sustainable, particularly in the light of the fact that the volume of air traffic doubles every 10 to 15 years. When the amount of traffic doubles, the safety risk increases fourfold.', 'This led us in 2004 to initiate the single European sky concept.

425," 12. The performance and sustainability of the European aviation system - Aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services (debate) ","  Antonio Tajani,  Vice-President of the Commission. − (IT) Madam President, honourable Members, I am very pleased that this House has voted unanimously, or virtually unanimously, in favour of the single European sky reform. I understand that only Mr Nattrass is against it, but I do not understand why: perhaps either I have not understood, or he has not read the draft single European sky reform properly. I do not understand what the Soviet Union has to do with it: everyone is free to say what he or she wants; I do not feel nostalgic about the Soviet Union.However, with regard to the serious points contained and raised in the debate, I should like to point out that this is a practical response that we are providing to a crisis within the air transport sector. The data supplied today by IATA are worrying. According to statements made by the Director-General, in this financial year the sector stands to lose USD 4.7 billion, or almost EUR 3.5 billion, thus performing worse than was initially expected. Its profits are set to drop by 12%.Thus faced with a crisis of this kind, we are however capable of introducing cost-cutting standards. In all, once applied and working at full capacity, the entire reform, including SESAR, should lead to a total saving of approximately EUR 40 billion, and then the next important figure – and I think that this is close to Mrs Lichtenberger’s heart – is also that of the reduction in pollution, which will be substantial.With regard to the problem raised by Mr Zīle concerning reciprocity and overflight taxes to be imposed on all aeroplanes flying over Siberia, the issue was the subject of an agreement signed with Russia, but it has not yet been applied. We have raised the problem during several meetings with the competent transport ministers. It was also raised at the last summit the European Commission had in Moscow with Mr Putin and Mr Medvedev, and with the transport minister, with whom I met bilaterally. I do not see significant progress being made by Russia, but we shall persevere.The principle of reciprocity, which could have been included in the text, did not receive the Council’s support. Most of the Member States opposed it, and so a debate was held at the last Council of Transport Ministers. Since there was no possibility of including it, it was not included in the legislative text.However, with regard to the issues raised by Mr Romagnoli concerning the airports in the city of Rome, I can say that, as usual, checks are always performed by the European Commission. I can say that, as regards the application of the regulation safeguarding passengers with reduced mobility, Fiumicino and Ciampino airports can be held up as examples because they applied the Community regulation earlier than other airports, so much so that I even presented the new regulation at the end of July last year at Fiumicino airport.This does not mean that we should rest on our laurels: I am thinking of the scandalous business of the 42 million items of luggage that are mishandled across the world, of the 1 million suitcases or bags that are lost. Faced with this data I have launched an inquiry by the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport. I have allowed one month for answers to be obtained from all the competent organisations, and if these answers confirm the data supplied and featured in the press, I shall set about proposing a reform of the existing regulation, which I consider to be slightly weak as regards passenger protection. I am thinking of perhaps entrusting some national bodies with the task of checking that the Community regulation is applied.My attention is certainly focused on the ‘passenger rights’ issue, and so I wish to reassure you, in response to the question put by Mr Romagnoli, and to reassure Parliament as a whole, as well as to confirm my ongoing commitment to try to safeguard passenger rights even more. It is no coincidence that, following the regulation submitted and approved on air transport, regulations on maritime transport and bus transport are being discussed.I would also say to Mr Evans that the criteria taken into consideration are the commercial value of airports and runway length, to which he referred. The definition to which he refers has been somewhat superseded by the criteria listed.I believe I can once again thank you and insist on the matter of air transport safety which, with this reform, will be even stronger, even though I am convinced that flying in European skies today is safe, but there are never any limits where safety is concerned. We must always do more, and therefore in all of these sectors in which it is possible to strengthen transport safety I will see through my commitment in full, and I will try to submit proposals to Parliament and the Council that really show EU citizens that the European institutions are there to help them.To conclude, I am grateful to you once again. I am grateful to Mr Marinescu, but I wish to thank all the Members, all the coordinators, all the elected representatives who have taken the floor during this debate, because we could not have done without such a strong commitment from Parliament – which has shown on this occasion that it does not want to waste any time – to intervene in practice on issues that directly affect EU citizens, a commitment that it has made alongside the Commission. I am also grateful to the European Commission services, which have done so much, and I am pleased that during the speeches someone thanked the services, also, for their cooperation.Together, we have also all been able to make the aeronautical industry realise that the institutions are capable – I repeat and I stress – of tackling a difficult crisis. I believe that the people of Europe, the world of enterprise do not expect across-the-board aid or mere legislative measures from us, but need to be shown that the institutions are capable of being there, are capable of supporting the citizens, entrepreneurs and all those who are committed to tackling this crisis. They need to feel that the institutions are capable of standing by them and of supporting them in overcoming together this difficult period for the European economy, which will survive – and I am deeply convinced of this – by implementing serious and precise rules that apply to everyone.The lack of rules and existence of weak rules has given rise to the financial and economic crisis. We Europeans, who identify ourselves as part of a civilisation that is the fruit of Roman law and the Napoleonic code, which is based on rules and on respect for rules, are convinced that, thanks to these rules, we will be able to overcome the present difficulties and, above all, we will increasingly be able to have a system that is capable of being free but also of withstanding financial and economic difficulties.I thank you once again for your great commitment.

The definition to which he refers has been somewhat superseded by the criteria listed.', 'I believe I can once again thank you and insist on the matter of air transport safety which, with this reform, will be even stronger, even though I am convinced that flying in European skies today is safe, but there are never any limits where safety is concerned. We must always do more, and therefore in all of these sectors in which it is possible to strengthen transport safety I will see through my commitment in full, and I will try to submit proposals to Parliament and the Council that really show EU citizens that the European institutions are there to help them.', 'To conclude, I am grateful to you once again. I am grateful to Mr Marinescu, but I wish to thank all the Members, all the coordinators, all the elected representatives who have taken the floor during this debate, because we could not have done without such a strong commitment from Parliament – which has shown on this occasion that it does not want to waste any time – to intervene in practice on issues that directly affect EU citizens, a commitment that it has made alongside the Commission. I am also grateful to the European Commission services, which have done so much, and I am pleased that during the speeches someone thanked the services, also, for their cooperation.', 'Together, we have also all been able to make the aeronautical industry realise that the institutions are capable – I repeat and I stress – of tackling a difficult crisis. I believe that the people of Europe, the world of enterprise do not expect across-the-board aid or mere legislative measures from us, but need to be shown that the institutions are capable of being there, are capable of supporting the citizens, entrepreneurs and all those who are committed to tackling this crisis. They need to feel that the institutions are capable of standing by them and of supporting them in overcoming together this difficult period for the European economy, which will survive – and I am deeply convinced of this – by implementing serious and precise rules that apply to everyone.', 'The lack of rules and existence of weak rules has given rise to the financial and economic crisis. We Europeans, who identify ourselves as part of a civilisation that is the fruit of Roman law and the Napoleonic code, which is based on rules and on respect for rules, are convinced that, thanks to these rules, we will be able to overcome the present difficulties and, above all, we will increasingly be able to have a system that is capable of being free but also of withstanding financial and economic difficulties.', 'I thank you once again for your great commitment.

The hundreds of millions of useless chargers and adapters in Europe place a ridiculous burden on the environment and, at the same time, are an expensive irritation for consumers. Nowadays, anyone who changes their mobile phone generally needs a completely different charger. Even different models from the same manufacturer do not use a standardised charger.This is not a new issue. However, it is important to realise that charging a mobile phone is not like filling a car with petrol; it is a technically more complex issue. A few years ago, the technology had not yet reached a level where complete harmonisation was possible, in particular because of safety risks. Mobile phones could overheat or even explode during the charging process.In the meantime, these difficulties have been overcome and there are no technical reasons which would prevent harmonisation.Therefore, I have taken specific steps to encourage the industry to bring a standard charger onto the market.I am confident that the industry will act quickly. However, in our role as a European institution we must stay on the ball. We should under no circumstances exclude the possibility of introducing legal regulations. As you perhaps already know, at their most recent congress in Barcelona the network operators announced that from 2012 onwards it will be possible to charge the majority of the new mobile phones that they sell with a single standardised charger.This is good, but it does not go far enough. The Commission would like to see complete harmonisation on the basis of a uniform standard and a binding undertaking from the industry to do this. The Commission expects the industry to produce a binding agreement in the form of a memorandum by the end of April. This memorandum should be signed by the major manufacturers of mobile phones and should ensure that every charger is capable of charging every mobile phone and that every mobile phone can be charged by every charger.The Commission will not hesitate to make a legislative proposal if the industry does not introduce a voluntary agreement.I expect that the problem will automatically be resolved for other devices, such as digital cameras and MP3 players, once we have made the breakthrough with mobile phones.

437, 14. Interoperability of mobile chargers (debate) ,"  Toine Manders,  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – (NL) Madam President, we are today discussing a subject that is of special interest to consumers, namely the standard connection for mobile phone chargers. As a Liberal, I am, of course, in favour of allowing the internal market to work and of the minimum possible amount of government intervention in the market. That said, consumers must also have choices. At the moment, consumers buying a new phone have no choice at all. The charger must automatically be bought with the phone, and this frequently gives rise to great annoyance amongst consumers. What is more, research shows that consumers spend EUR 300 million a year on new chargers because they are automatically included with the purchase of new phones. The result of this is that there, too, the environment is also burdened to the tune of EUR 300 million a year, and that is without mentioning the waste of energy that these cheap chargers cause, as they are often left in the socket even after the phone itself has been disconnected, where they continue to consume energy.My colleague, Mr Cappato, and I have been calling for years for the introduction of a European standard and I would very much like to compliment the Commissioner for the manner in which he has regulated this by flirting a little with the industry whilst also threatening it, saying to it, ‘You come up with a solution or, if not, we will introduce binding legislation’. I would like to congratulate him even more on that approach, as, being a Liberal, I am against mandatory regulation where coaxing can be used instead. Coaxing means that people prefer to do something because they see the benefit of it and I think that the Commissioner has achieved exceptional success in this.I have told the following little joke a few times before: when I met my wife 35 years ago, I coaxed her into going out with me. If I had forced her, she would probably not have seen the added value we have now and the idea would therefore not have lasted this long. I believe that this example also applies to the industry, as, if the industry has to resolve the issue itself, it will make a better job of it than if the solution is laid down by politicians.I therefore think that this is an excellent solution. I hope that, in time, you will manage not only to bring in a standard for phone chargers but also for more items of electrical equipment, as the same irritation applies to those other electrical appliances. If a family goes away for a weekend, it might take 30 chargers with it. There are always people, including in this House today, for instance, who have to ask whether anyone has a charger they can borrow as they have forgotten their own. You then need to find a specific charger of a specific make and model. My compliments, again, Commissioner. I hope that this really happens in 2012 and I hope that you act strongly if the industry does not live up to its commitments, as that is very important. You have to keep the big stick in reserve, but preferably reach a solution through coaxing and self-regulation. You have succeeded in that, and you have my congratulations.

Coaxing means that people prefer to do something because they see the benefit of it and I think that the Commissioner has achieved exceptional success in this.', 'I have told the following little joke a few times before: when I met my wife 35 years ago, I coaxed her into going out with me. If I had forced her, she would probably not have seen the added value we have now and the idea would therefore not have lasted this long. I believe that this example also applies to the industry, as, if the industry has to resolve the issue itself, it will make a better job of it than if the solution is laid down by politicians.', 'I therefore think that this is an excellent solution. I hope that, in time, you will manage not only to bring in a standard for phone chargers but also for more items of electrical equipment, as the same irritation applies to those other electrical appliances. If a family goes away for a weekend, it might take 30 chargers with it. There are always people, including in this House today, for instance, who have to ask whether anyone has a charger they can borrow as they have forgotten their own. You then need to find a specific charger of a specific make and model. My compliments, again, Commissioner. I hope that this really happens in 2012 and I hope that you act strongly if the industry does not live up to its commitments, as that is very important. You have to keep the big stick in reserve, but preferably reach a solution through coaxing and self-regulation. You have succeeded in that, and you have my congratulations. ']"

442, 15. Common consular instructions: biometric identifiers and visa applications (debate) ,"  Sarah Ludford,  rapporteur. − Madam President, this Commission proposal, on which I am Parliament’s rapporteur, is the fourth element of the Visa Information System (VIS) package, coming after the VIS regulation, the VIS access decision and the measure on the use of the VIS under the Schengen Borders Code.In modifying the existing common consular instructions, it provides firstly for the obligation to supply biometrics which will be stored in the VIS and the standards for doing so, but secondly it includes provisions on the organisation of receiving visa applications.A complete revision of the visa rules is foreseen with the visa code on which my ALDE Group colleague, Henrik Lax, is rapporteur. Once adopted, this piece of legislation which we are now discussing will become an integral part of the visa code. The underlying rationale for separating the proposals was that the Commission expected the adoption of the visa code to take longer than the present proposal, and they did not want the adoption of the visa code to hold up the launch of the VIS.It is my understanding that the central system for the VIS will be ready by December this year and could start operating in the first region, North Africa, in early 2010. I have been negotiating with the Council for quite a long time. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted my report in November 2007. Unfortunately we could not get a first-reading agreement, so in July 2008 I asked Parliament to endorse my report; however, during the French Presidency we were able to make sufficient progress for me to be able to recommend adopting this compromise at second reading.We had four outstanding issues: the age limit for fingerprinting; encouraging Member States to cooperate while permitting contracts with external providers as a last resort; data protection and security; and a service fee for external providers.On fingerprinting the Commission proposed to start fingerprinting children at six years old. In fact fingerprints of young children are subject to rapid change, and I have not been persuaded that enough is yet known about the reliability in later years of prints taken so young. Despite many requests, I was never provided with credible substantive evidence about how fingerprints taken between six and twelve years of age could be the basis for verification or identification many years later without the risk of mistakes.The Council’s reaction at one stage was to propose fingerprinting young children every two years instead of five years, as is the case with adults, but that would be hugely inconvenient for families. So I insisted on a prudent and practical approach, taking a higher minimum age of twelve years, and the Council did agree to exempt children under twelve, with a review of this age limit after three years following a detailed study under the responsibility of the Commission.I now turn to the issue of encouraging Member State cooperation while permitting external providers. I do not have any problems with the general concept of outsourcing, but there must be secure conditions to ensure the integrity of the visa-issuing process, to ensure that outsourcing is only a last resort and that data protection and security are guaranteed.We therefore succeeded in writing into the text a hierarchy whereby cooperation by means of limited representation, co-location or common application centres is the first choice, and only where those solutions are not appropriate to cope with a high number of applicants or secure a good geographical coverage does outsourcing come into play. The compromise makes clear that Member States remain responsible for compliance with data protection rules and for any breaches of national law.An important element is that, in third states that prohibit encryption, special rules apply: electronic transfer of data between consulates or between an external service provider and the Member State would be banned, and Member States would have to ensure that the electronic data is transferred physically in fully encrypted form on a CD which has special conditions attached to it.Lastly, on the visa fee, we have successfully insisted, as a condition for the external provider’s imposing a service fee on top of the visa fee, that visa applicants should always have the possibility of direct access to the consulate offices. I think that is very important.Overall we have a reasonable deal. Compromises were hard-fought, and I think we have made a step forward on the common visa policy.

Second, the establishment of the principle according to which the collection of biometric data by the consulates of Member States can be subcontracted to private bodies only as a last resort and within a strict framework of certain very specific guarantees.I know that some people believe that the adopted solution does not entirely fit in with the options that we had proposed, particularly regarding collection by a service provider, in a diplomatic office, and data transfer via encrypted electronic mail, or even via encrypted electronic data carriers transported in a diplomatic bag.We would reply, however, that collection by private bodies may be carried out only in accordance with European legislation and that the data must be fully encoded by the service provider and transmitted to the authorities of the Member State.Moreover, we have obtained the reference to the need for agreements to be negotiated with third countries that prohibit the encoding of data transmitted via electronic means.

Nevertheless, I will be abstaining from voting, mainly because I do believe that taking fingerprints and the entire process of using biometric identifiers is out of proportion to the size of the problem. I think that the desire of home affairs ministers and security authorities to collect as much personal data as possible is deeply questionable.I know how difficult it was to extract the compromise from the Council which exempts children under the age of 12 from the obligation to provide fingerprints. However, we all know that this will only apply provided that there are no comprehensive studies in place which prove that children’s fingerprints are reliable. The political discussion about whether babies’ and small children’s fingerprints are really needed is not yet over.The regulations on outsourcing also cause me some concern. Strict, standardised regulations are certainly needed, as some Member States are already using external service providers. It is understandable that in many strictly limited cases it can be useful to transfer the processing of visa applications to external service providers. However, this must not be done at the expense of the applicants and of data security. I do not believe that the compromise agreed with the Council in this respect is adequate. Both the Legal Service of the Parliament and the European Data Protection Supervisor have indicated the risks involved in outsourcing, when the external service provider is not in an area under diplomatic protection. Unfortunately, the Council has ignored these concerns.A further problem is the service charge involved in outsourcing. I believe it is wrong to pass this charge on to the applicants. The visa fee of EUR 60 is already too high and very difficult for people from third countries to afford. If a charge of up to EUR 30 is added, this does not correspond with my idea of an open and hospitable Europe. Undoubtedly it can make things easier in the case of very large countries not to have to travel halfway across the country to a consulate to apply for a visa, but instead to be able to submit the application to an external service provider.

448, 15. Common consular instructions: biometric identifiers and visa applications (debate) ,"  Gerard Batten,  on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. – Madam President, it comes as no surprise to hear Baroness Ludford of the Euro-fanatic Liberal Democrat party wanting to harmonise yet another area of what should be sovereign national policy. Why on earth would any EU Member State want a common system for the application and processing of visas for third-party nationals? Deciding who can and cannot enter a nation state should be the sole concern of the nation state – except that, in the minds of the Euro-fanatics, European nation states no longer exist, having been replaced by the great EU borderless state.Since 1997, about 6 million migrants have entered the UK. About 4 million have left, leaving a net population increase of over 2 million. The current immigration rate to Britain now results in a net population gain of over 200 000 people per year – or a net population gain of over 1 million people every five years. This is equivalent to a new city the size of Birmingham. Most of these migrants enter legally, because they are EU citizens. In addition to that, we probably have one million illegal immigrants. England is one of the most densely populated countries in the world – more densely populated than India, China or Japan.

Having done that, we need to decide which countries’ citizens we allow in, with or without a visa. There are many Member States in the EU whose citizens should not be allowed into Britain without a visa. What Britain needs is a strict visa system so that we can decide who we allow into our country and who we do not. What we do not need is a system devised by the European Union.I expect that its advocates would justify it as merely introducing common criteria and processes to make everything run more smoothly. However, it might have some unintended consequences. Look at another example of EU legislation championed by the Liberal Democrats. The European arrest warrant means that British citizens accused of a crime by other EU Member States cannot now be protected by British courts or even the Home Secretary, even when it is obvious that a grave injustice is being done. Any corrupt legal system may now demand the surrender of a British citizen, and we have to comply. We have surrendered the right to protect our own citizens. Soon we will have trials in absentia and the common recognition of fines and confiscation orders. All this was voted for and welcomed by the Liberal Democrats. These measures overturn the most basic freedoms enjoyed by the English for centuries, as enshrined in Magna Carta and the 1689 Bill of Rights.This afternoon, Graham Watson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, urged Gordon Brown to take Britain into the European single currency, which is something that anyone in touch with the real world would know is economic suicide.

Why on earth would any EU Member State want a common system for the application and processing of visas for third-party nationals?

449, 15. Common consular instructions: biometric identifiers and visa applications (debate) ,"  Carlos Coelho  (PPE-DE).   – (PT) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree that the Visa Information System or VIS urgently needs to be brought into operation, and that we need a Community code on visas. I acknowledge the work done by Baroness Ludford, but, in all conscience, I cannot support the compromise for several reasons.Firstly, I disagree with the use of external service providers. When we adopted the second version of the Schengen Information System, SIS II, with the agreement of all the political groups, this Parliament refused to allow private companies to have access to the data, even though at the time this merely involved car registrations. What justifies Parliament’s radical change in position in allowing private companies to gather these data, which are sensitive personal data, such as fingerprints? These companies will be able to retain these data for one week, according to the terms laid down in the compromise.Secondly, there should have been better data protection. Diplomatic protection is vital to ensure effective protection of the personal rights of individuals. How can the protection of data gathered by private companies be guaranteed, given that this diplomatic protection has not been assured? Are we already forgetting the SWIFT case, involving the transmission of data gathered by the US authorities? If this type of situation can happen in a country like the United States, just imagine what could happen in less developed countries with less protection of fundamental rights.Thirdly, the cost of visas will rise and will vary from country to country. The Commission proposal aimed to prevent visa shopping. By allowing private companies to charge a fee which will be added to the visa price, this will create a difference in the cost of visas from one Member State to another. We will therefore be encouraging exactly what we wanted to combat, namely visa shopping. If the cost of a visa in one Member State is EUR 60 and in another it is EUR 90, where will most of the applications be made? This will particularly apply in the case of families with several members. This is without even mentioning the need to review the visa facilitation agreements, which were so firmly supported by this Parliament, such as those with the Ukraine and Serbia.As a result of all this, Madam President, I cannot accept this compromise.

In addition, applicants do not need to visit the visa office every time as the data can be stored for up to five years.I believe it is also more citizen-friendly if the process can be made shorter by calling for the cooperation of the Member States or bringing in external service providers, if the data protection regulations are followed.

460, 16. Novel foods (debate) ,"  Kartika Tamara Liotard,  rapporteur. – (NL) Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, as they helped me a great deal in improving the Commission report. I must also mention the cooperation with the Czech Presidency. They, too, had a good deal of positive input to offer and we were only a couple of small unresolved issues away from reaching an agreement at first reading, although it is, in any case, that bit more democratic to have a vote in the House first.When I first heard that the Commission was putting forward a proposal for a regulation on novel foods, I did wonder what was meant by ‘novel foods’. I was also surprised that the Commission proposal took the internal market as its starting point.I will begin with that point. Like so many topics in this Parliament, this topic, too, can be approached from the perspective of the internal market, the producer or the economy. It can also be approached, however, from the point of view of food safety, consumers, health and the environment: in other words, on the basis of the welfare of the European citizen. In the EU, there is much talk about the environment and animal welfare and my thought was that this report should be more than just words: we should have action too. So when there was a choice to be made in my report on novel foods, in the first instance I opted for food safety, consumer welfare, the environment and animal welfare. I sincerely hope, and indeed the shadow rapporteurs have already informed me that it will be the case, that they support me on this point in the vote.Innovation is, of course, tremendously important. That brings me on to my second point, namely what are ‘novel foods’, actually? That was never really made clear in the Commission proposal. The Commission informed me that what we were talking about was, for instance, nanotechnology and meat from cloned animals. Let me deal with nanotechnology first. I had absolutely no idea what it was. I think that lots of consumers are in the same position, but it appears that it already occurs in our food more than we might think: in energy drinks, in packaging materials for fruit and vegetables, but also in the likes of certain oils and teas. Regulation is therefore needed very urgently, as technology is all well and good, and can be a boon for the consumer, but we do need to know for sure that the food on our tables is safe. It therefore needs to come within the scope of the regulation.Turning to meat from cloned animals, Parliament has already stated in a resolution to the Commission that it did not want meat from cloned animals on the market as food. If meat from cloned animals were to come within the scope of this regulation, we, as Parliament, would be admitting indirectly that we would, in fact, approve of meat of this nature coming onto our market. That is not acceptable, and meat from cloned animals must therefore be left outside the scope of this regulation. This is not really a safety issue. Cloning for meat is usually associated with a great deal of animal suffering, and many of these cloned animals do not even live for long. It therefore has no added value for food supply at this point in time.

It can also be approached, however, from the point of view of food safety, consumers, health and the environment: in other words, on the basis of the welfare of the European citizen. In the EU, there is much talk about the environment and animal welfare and my thought was that this report should be more than just words: we should have action too. So when there was a choice to be made in my report on novel foods, in the first instance I opted for food safety, consumer welfare, the environment and animal welfare.

Novel foods (debate) ,"  Androulla Vassiliou,  Member of the Commission. − Madam President, on 15 January 2008, the Commission submitted its proposal on novel foods to the Council and the European Parliament, with the aim of simplifying the administrative burden for food-business operators when requesting pre-market approval for innovative food products.The current proposal maintains the principle of the need for pre-market authorisation for innovative products, to reassure consumers that new breeding or new production techniques are safe for humans and animals and respect the environment and consumers’ interests.The proposal streamlines and speeds up the authorisation process through a centralised food safety evaluation by EFSA and sets precise deadlines at every stage of the procedure. It also includes an improved safety assessment, tailor-made to different types of foods, thereby allowing safe traditional food from third countries to enter the EU more easily.I would like to welcome the work of Parliament, whose report addresses major issues concerning the development of a safe food sector. I would particularly like to confirm my support for the following principles: the need for a definition of engineered nanomaterials and the clarification that all such products require a case-by-case authorisation by the EU institutions; and the confirmation of the fact that food products from cloned animals are novel foods and therefore cannot be placed on the market without having been assessed by EFSA and authorised through a regulatory procedure.I look forward to hearing your opinions on these sensitive issues and would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Liotard, and the shadow rapporteurs for their valuable work on this important report.

I am sorry that my fellow Members are unfamiliar with the link to the regulation on genetically modified food products and animal feed. Genetically modified food products were exempted from the effects of this regulation because at the present time they fall under a separate regulation and there is no reason for duplication here. I am therefore opposed to the proposals concerning the protection of animals and the environment, animal feeds and genetically modified food products. They simply do not belong in this regulation and tend to complicate the proposal, even though they represent a very important area.

Novel foods (debate) ,"  Magor Imre Csibi,  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, novel food regulations should provide for the diversification of food products on the European market, while ensuring that these new products are safe for the consumer.However, under the current regulation very few novel foods are approved on the EU market due to highly complex application and assessment procedures. If we had applied the current procedures to the authorisation of the potato or the kiwi fruit we might not have them on our table today. The revision of the current regulation should aim to set up a more efficient and practicable system for the authorisation of novel foods.I understand some of my colleagues’ concerns about allowing on the market new products that might present a danger or mislead the consumer. However, we should not fall into the trap of safety hysteria and kill innovation, and we should not discriminate against novel food, placing it a less favourable position than products already on the market that do not necessarily have a nutritional advantage for consumers; nevertheless, consumers have freedom of choice.My group is generally satisfied with the outcome of the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. However, there are certain issues that go far beyond the scope of this regulation, and consequently we will not be able to support it. For example, we cannot demand that a novel food has no negative impact on the environment. Whether we like it or not, all human activities have an impact on the environment, and such a provision is disproportionate in this context. Instead, my group believes we need to strike the right balance between encouraging innovation and applying the precautionary principle concerning food safety, consumer and environmental protection and animal welfare.Our approach was to ease the long and bureaucratic procedures for putting novel foods on the market and protecting the industry’s investments by means of reinforced data protection.To that end, for the plenary vote we have retabled a set of amendments to facilitate the procedure for products that are similar to foods or ingredients already existing on the market and where the authorisation procedure has already started under the old Regulation. Applications pending under the old Regulation should be completed according to the rules in force at the time of the submission of the dossier. Reintroducing the application under the revised Regulation would only mean further delays and costs for the industry.At the same time, we also tried to promote the interests of consumers by reinforcing implementing measures on, for example, marketing and monitoring, supporting the exclusion of cloned animals from the food chain, and specific labelling provisions.On the issue of cloning, I strongly support the exclusion of foods from cloned animals and their descendants from the scope of this Regulation, and call on the Commission to ban cloned animals in the food chain. In September 2008 the European Parliament adopted by a large majority a resolution asking for a ban on cloned animals from the food supply.We must be consistent in the political message we send to the Commission and to citizens. There are still fundamental questions to be addressed regarding the ethical implications of cloning animals for food supply, and even the implication of animal cloning on human health and animal welfare.Therefore, the novel food regulation is not an appropriate framework for such a complex issue. If, in the future, food products derived from cloned animals are to be introduced on the European market, it should be done by means of a specific regulation submitted for public consultation and then democratically adopted.I believe Parliament needs to take a strong stand and, by means of a majority vote, put pressure on the Commission to find solutions that echo the will of the citizens.We will also support labelling of nano-ingredients. People have the right to know what they eat and make their choices accordingly. If some people are concerned about nanotechnology, then they should be able to make a different choice.

Unfortunately, some amendments have been tabled with the aim of adding objectives to this proposal which are not compatible with the goals of the regulation or which even interfere with existing case law. The obligation on food suppliers to monitor novel foods in terms of the health and welfare of animals would impose too great a burden on retailers.Once again an attempt is being made to undermine existing GMO legislation, in this case the call for special labelling for novel foods which come from animals that have been fed genetically modified feedstuffs. We have already heard about all of this.Anything which involves GMO legislation should not be included in the regulation on novel foods. I say this, but I myself tabled an amendment to distinguish between new plant types and the definition of novel foods. However, interested parties in this House must not be allowed to misuse the regulation on novel foods for electioneering purposes. Amendments 62 and 90, for which the Greens have requested a vote by roll call, are obviously an attempt of this kind. Who are you aiming to pillory for this? My group has always supported the right of the consumer to know what foods contain. Why should there not be a reference to nanosubstances in the list of ingredients? Although amendment 62 makes a rather clumsy attempt to anticipate my report on food labelling, I must say that I believe that the labelling of novel foods is fully compatible with my report.Therefore I recommend that my group votes in favour of the amendments. In my report on food labelling regulations, I will refer to the part of the regulation on novel foods which concerns labelling. This will be possible because the first reading on the labelling of foods has been postponed to the next parliamentary term, against the Greens’ wishes.

We have already heard about all of this.', 'Anything which involves GMO legislation should not be included in the regulation on novel foods. I say this, but I myself tabled an amendment to distinguish between new plant types and the definition of novel foods. However, interested parties in this House must not be allowed to misuse the regulation on novel foods for electioneering purposes. Amendments 62 and 90, for which the Greens have requested a vote by roll call, are obviously an attempt of this kind. Who are you aiming to pillory for this? My group has always supported the right of the consumer to know what foods contain. Why should there not be a reference to nanosubstances in the list of ingredients? Although amendment 62 makes a rather clumsy attempt to anticipate my report on food labelling, I must say that I believe that the labelling of novel foods is fully compatible with my report.', 'Therefore I recommend that my group votes in favour of the amendments. In my report on food labelling regulations, I will refer to the part of the regulation on novel foods which concerns labelling. This will be possible because the first reading on the labelling of foods has been postponed to the next parliamentary term, against the Greens’ wishes. However, it has now become clear how beneficial this postponement was for them.', 'A brief remark on cloning. It is animal cruelty and we are opposed to it.

469, 16. Novel foods (debate) ,"  Csaba Sándor Tabajdi  (PSE). -  (HU) It is very reassuring to European consumers that they can have every confidence in the EU foodstuffs on their plates. In the medium and long terms, this is one of the most important reasons for maintaining the common agricultural policy. We have to compensate European producers for the fact that we impose stricter food safety and environmental protection rules than our competitors outside the European Union.It would be good if we were to succeed, at the WTO negotiations, in asserting our rightful demand that our global competitors should observe equally strict norms and standards for stringent food safety, animal and plant health and environmental protection.The regulation on novel foods and the amendment presented in this report are also intended to serve increased food safety. At the same time, the challenges presented by the current global food crisis and the steady increase in population heighten the importance of, and indeed render essential, the search for new solutions. In order for the earth to be able to feed 9 billion people in 2050, the opportunities presented by technological advances, and primarily the use of biotechnologies, are indispensable.To avoid misunderstanding, this report does not address genetically modified foods. In accordance with the Commission’s intentions, however, foods prepared with nanotechnologies do fall within the scope of novel foods. Some of my fellow Members have concerns, which I understand up to a point, but it is important for us to recognise that nanotechnology is one of the keys to the future.Europe would suffer a serious competitive disadvantage if it were left out of developments in this area. The key is the scientific, comprehensive testing that accompanies the licensing process, guaranteed by the proposed regulation. A major consideration is the strict regulatory system of labelling. We must not allow the foods in question to be open to misleading consumers.There is also a significant debate concerning cloned animals. It would be more appropriate to regulate cloning in a separate regulation. Following the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, we should not consider the offspring of cloned animals to be clones, but the regulation should nonetheless refer to the offspring of cloned animals as well.

Novel foods (debate) ,"  Mojca Drčar Marko  (ALDE). -   Madam President, last year we voted with a persuasive majority in favour of the resolution proposing to ban the cloning of animals for food and the sale of any products from cloned animals and their offspring.Ahead of voting on the legislation on novel foods we should recall the reasons for having been prudent and aware of risks for the health and welfare of animals. We know, from our past experience with similar issues that tackle both food safety and ethical relations between humans, as the dominant species, and nature, that public perception depends very much on specific knowledge of the matter. Consumers are increasingly sensitive about suffering and injuries to farm animals and therefore they have the right to be informed about the potential of cloning to cause pain and to waste natural resources. Yet the development of animal cloning as a method of food production is being pursued without public awareness.The problems with cloning do not concern just the welfare of animals, but also consumer confidence in food since it is believed that in Europe food is produced to a very high standard. The Eurobarometer study from last October documented serious public concerns with regard to hypothetical future use of food products from clones. This is linked to the sale of imported food, which could eventually be sold in Europe without being labelled as a product from cloned animals. I therefore agree with the rapporteur’s approach urging the Commission to come up with a separate piece of legislation on clones.Among other problems which have been covered by the amendments tabled by my political group, I wish particularly to support the sharing of information from animal testing so as to avoid the need for new tests involving animals.Finally, many thanks to the rapporteur for her thorough work on this important piece of European legislation tackling food safety, as well as consumer protection, and animal health and welfare.

474, 16. Novel foods (debate) ,"  Androulla Vassiliou,  Member of the Commission. − Madam President, I would like to elaborate on a few very important points which were made by honourable Members.Concerning nanotechnologies, I have taken note of recent scientific opinions and I am convinced by the related documents in Mrs Liotard’s report. The European Union will be first in the world to have a regulatory definition of engineered nanomaterials and a coherent and flexible approach to this technology.In order to clarify the Commission’s position on the definition of nanotechnologies, I would like to make the following statement on behalf of the Commission.The Commission notes that work towards a common definition of nanomaterials is still evolving. The Commission therefore confirms that, in future Community legislation, progress on the common definition should be taken into account, and notes that the comitology procedures included in this proposal also enable the definition in this proposal to be updated.Regarding the mandatory labelling of all food produced with the aid of nanotechnology, I would like to note that the Commission is indeed in favour of consumer information about the presence of nanomaterials in food. However, under the Novel Food Regulation we have a case-by-case authorisation which also lays down conditions for use of such products, including the labelling requirements. Labelling will thus be examined on a case-by-case basis.Let me now clarify my position on the important issue of cloning. I have already stated that I consider that the Novel Food Regulation is not the most suitable instrument for managing all the issues of cloning. Novel Food only deals with food safety and market authorisation. Therefore the use of clones in breeding programmes – semen, embryos and ova – cannot be regulated under the Novel Food Regulation, nor can issues linked to animal health and welfare be addressed here.On 13 January, the College of Commissioners held an orientation debate on the cloning of farm animals for food production. The Commission agreed that there remain a number of unanswered questions. In this respect the Commission is working closely with EFSA and ensuring that related scientific research is conducted. At the same time, I launched discussions with our main trading partners: the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.Yes, we need more information and data on cloning techniques and the way in which progenies of cloned animals should be handled from a regulatory perspective.As some of you have mentioned, in July last year the European Food Safety Authority delivered its opinion covering the scientific aspects of cloning for food in the EU. The general conclusion of the opinion is that the risk assessment is insufficient due to the limited data available. With regard to the health and welfare of animals, the opinion makes it clear that a significant proportion of clones have been found to be adversely affected, often severely, and with a fatal outcome both for cloned animals and for the surrogate animal.The opinion of the European Group on Ethics also highlights a number of scientific questions that need to be answered, and research that needs to be carried out, on food safety, animal health and welfare, traceability and labelling.In conclusion, I wish to acknowledge that, with regard to cloning, there is certainly an issue to be addressed, but the Novel Food Regulation is not the right place to regulate all the questions surrounding this sensitive matter.Nevertheless, I would like to make a commitment, on behalf of the Commission, to produce, as soon as possible, a comprehensive report on all aspects of cloning techniques with a view to the production of foodstuffs, including animal health and welfare in relation to clones and their offspring, accompanied, if appropriate, by legislative proposals.

478, 17. Substances that deplete the ozone layer (recast) (debate) ,"  Johannes Blokland,  rapporteur. – (NL) Madam President, closing the hole in the ozone layer is important for the environment and for the public health of the population of the whole world. Our atmosphere is formed in such a way that there are two different layers that protect us. The CO2 in the tropospheric layer holds in the warmth so that we do not get too cold. The ozone in the stratospheric layer protects us from harmful UV radiation from the sun. The regulation on substances that deplete the ozone layer is primarily aimed at protecting the stratospheric ozone layer, but also at preventing climate change. Thus, those substances that are being prohibited act both to deplete the ozone and to increase global warming. The predominant substances that deplete the ozone layer are found in aerosol propellants, refrigerators, insulating materials and certain specific solvents and cleaning agents. The CFCs and halons that have the strongest ozone-depleting effect have been completely eliminated, save for a limited number of exceptions. It is already prohibited to produce HCFCs, and their use will be banned from 2020. The preamble to the new regulation states that the production and use of ozone-depleting substances is to be ended or minimised as far as possible. This is an important policy basis.Sixty-four amendments were adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. There were then two trialogues, which resulted in an agreement between the Council and Parliament. This meant that the 64 amendments were replaced by a single, consolidated text. I would like to briefly mention nine important results of that agreement.First of all, the legal basis for the regulation has been changed to the environment. That allows the Member States the possibility of adopting more far-reaching measures to protect the environment. Secondly, the use of the pesticide methyl bromide will be prohibited as of 18 March 2010. This also applies to the gassing of containers to control vermin. The only remaining exception will be for emergencies, such as where a large-scale epidemic occurs. The third point is that, in the phasing-out programme for HCFCs, the percentage with respect to 1997 has been cut back to 7% for the final years. Fourthly, HCFCs may only be used in government-designated businesses. Fifthly, some new substances have been added to the list of substances that are nominated for restrictive measures. The European Commission has undertaken to investigate these substances further. Point six is that, for the necessary exceptions, such as for use as reagents and for laboratory use, labelling is being laid down as a mandatory requirement. It has also been agreed, in this regard, that there must be no increase in laboratory use. Point seven is that the reuse and recycling of ozone-depleting substances for existing apparatus may only take place within one business. In addition, a log must be kept of the quantities present in order to prevent fraud and illegal trade. The eighth point is that attention is being given to enforcement by means of inspections. In that way, Member States are obliged to work together to tackle illegal trade. The final point is that, in order to prevent leaks of ozone-depleting substances, the monitoring and enforcement system is to be tightened up.There is, however, more to be done in order to tackle the problem of stored ozone-depleting substances. The Commission has an important job here. I would like to urge it once again to develop the directive on construction and demolition waste along the lines we agreed seven years ago in the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.All in all, we have achieved a satisfactory result.

Our atmosphere is formed in such a way that there are two different layers that protect us. The CO2 in the tropospheric layer holds in the warmth so that we do not get too cold. The ozone in the stratospheric layer protects us from harmful UV radiation from the sun. The regulation on substances that deplete the ozone layer is primarily aimed at protecting the stratospheric ozone layer, but also at preventing climate change. Thus, those substances that are being prohibited act both to deplete the ozone and to increase global warming. The predominant substances that deplete the ozone layer are found in aerosol propellants, refrigerators, insulating materials and certain specific solvents and cleaning agents. The CFCs and halons that have the strongest ozone-depleting effect have been completely eliminated, save for a limited number of exceptions. It is already prohibited to produce HCFCs, and their use will be banned from 2020. The preamble to the new regulation states that the production and use of ozone-depleting substances is to be ended or minimised as far as possible. This is an important policy basis.', 'Sixty-four amendments were adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

479, 17. Substances that deplete the ozone layer (recast) (debate) ,"  Stavros Dimas,  Member of the Commission. − (EL) Madam President, I should like first of all to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, and all the shadow rapporteurs on their exceptional work on this proposal to recast the regulation on the protection of the ozone layer.I am particularly delighted that agreement has been reached at first reading, thanks in large part to the positive and constructive contribution made by Parliament.The policy on the protection of the ozone layer in the stratosphere has been acknowledged as a very great success and the European Union has played a decisive role here. Thanks to the innovative measures which we adopted in the European Union, we have succeeded in getting 99% of substances that deplete the ozone layer withdrawn.Apart from protecting the ozone layer, limiting these substances has extremely positive repercussions on the climate. That is because these substances have a global warming potential up to 14 000 times greater than that of CO2. Without the Montreal Protocol and without the even more ambitious Community regulation, emissions of greenhouse gases at global level would perhaps be up to 50% higher than they are at present.Thanks to these international efforts, scientists now estimate that the ozone layer can be fully restored between 2050 and 2075. However, in order to make this possible, a number of persistent problems need to be overcome. The Commission proposal is designed both to simplify the Community regulation and reduce bureaucratic obstacles and to bring the regulation into line with new scientific developments and future challenges, in order to guarantee the restoration of the ozone layer.The compromise agreement achieved retains the architecture of the Commission proposal but, at the same time, it includes the specific measures needed in order to address outstanding issues in terms of the full abolition or limitation on the use of substances which deplete the ozone layer.More importantly, it contains stricter provisions for substances which are 'stored' in products, such as, for example, refrigeration equipment or plastic insulating foam. It strengthens commercial measures against the illegal use of and illegal trade in substances that deplete the ozone layer in the European Union and will help to prevent environmental dumping in developing countries. Finally, it bans all uses of methyl bromide except in specific instances in order to deal with emergencies. This will put Community legislation on methyl bromide at the vanguard at global level.The benefits, both in terms of restoring the ozone layer and reducing greenhouse gases, will be considerable. The European Commission is in a position to accept in full the compromise package of amendments.I should like to thank the European Parliament once again for its significant contribution in keeping the environmental objective of the proposal intact and achieving agreement at first reading.

480, 17. Substances that deplete the ozone layer (recast) (debate) ,"  Eija-Riitta Korhola,  on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. – (FI) Madam President, the regulation before us is the natural continuation and an important part of the Montreal Protocol, which obliges its 191 signatory states actively to abandon the use of substances that deplete the ozone layer.The Montreal Protocol is considered to be one of the most successful of all international environmental agreements. The results speak for themselves. There has been a 95% reduction in consumption of ODS compared with the baselines set. Furthermore, greenhouse gas emissions will have been avoided over a 20-year period that are equivalent to more than 100 billion tonnes of CO2. That is why the regulation we are now considering will not just promote the recovery of the ozone layer: it is also an important part of the fight against climate change.The previous regulation, drafted nine years ago, was hopelessly behind the times, and it was necessary to bring it up to date. The simplification of the current regulation’s structure, the deletion of obsolete provisions and extending the obligation to file reports to cover new substances are reforms that were sorely needed. I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Blokland, very warmly on his work as Parliament’s rapporteur. The compromise at first reading, though challenging democratically, is a sensible solution for an update such as this one, and reaching it was in itself an environmental accomplishment.The now acceptable regulation will bring current Community regulations more appropriately in line with the original provisions of the Montreal Protocol. For example, bringing forward the deadline for ending the production of HCFCs by five years to 2020 is sensible and justified, as is reducing the number of exemptions to the ban on export trade. As the aims of this regulation cannot be satisfactorily achieved in our Community just through action on the part of the Member States, we need to address the problem globally, in the context of the global economy. If there were too many exceptions to the exports ban, it would be too difficult to show they were justifiable.The Montreal Protocol itself has had additions made to it no less than four times. The 20-year-old treaty was amended in this way in London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing. It is not just a success story: it is also a story of the necessity to correct mistaken trends as understanding increases. It is this same wisdom that we now need in the case of the Kyoto Protocol.The original Montreal Protocol focused on the protection of the ozone layer, mainly by restricting CFCs, and that goal was quickly tightened up almost to zero. So CFCs started to be replaced with HCFCs, for example, which were a lot less harmful to the ozone layer. As is often the way with solutions to environmental problems, however, another aspect to the problem emerged. HCFCs, or fluorinated gases, proved to be particularly harmful on account of their huge Global Warming Potential or GWP. Some of them are more than a thousand times more intense as global warmers than carbon dioxide. It thus became necessary to amend the weak points in the treaty.We need to be able to learn a lesson in the same way in the case of the Kyoto Treaty. It has to be admitted that it is not at all effective as it stands. It will not cut global emissions and will not even reduce carbon intensiveness. Perhaps the problem lies in the fact that those who were responsible for drafting the Kyoto Treaty assumed that the problem of carbon dioxide could be solved in the same way that applies to freons.Climate change is an environmental problem on a totally different scale from earlier problems. Whereas ozone depletion concerned problems that were generated by the by-products of industrial or energy production, the cause of climate change lies in something that sustains the entire global economy and global production. The world still runs on carbon. That is why climate change must be seen above all as a problem of industrial engineering. The focus of decisions needs to switch from restricting emissions to a comprehensive reorganisation of energy and material production systems. Let us learn a lesson from Montreal.

Our mutual cooperation has been excellent, in committee and in the negotiations. I would also like to thank the Czech Presidency for the sound agreements we were able to reach, both before and during the negotiations. In every case, the result was satisfactory.

I am not very happy with the recasting system. It is not easy to know on what basis you can or cannot make amendments. Luckily, there were lawyers to advise me that the legal basis had been changed in the recast so that we were able to make changes on that basis, otherwise it would have almost escaped our scrutiny.

In that way we will be obtaining precise information about this substance.', 'I would also like to convey my sincere thanks to my fellow Members, especially the shadow rapporteurs and those who have spoken this evening, for the support that I have received. Our mutual cooperation has been excellent, in committee and in the negotiations. I would also like to thank the Czech Presidency for the sound agreements we were able to reach, both before and during the negotiations. In every case, the result was satisfactory. I also very much appreciate the support received from the officials of the Commission and of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and from my own staff. We have truly managed to work as a team, which also made it possible for us to conclude this far-reaching amendment of the law within six months.', 'I have one more comment to make, in conclusion. I am not very happy with the recasting system. It is not easy to know on what basis you can or cannot make amendments. Luckily, there were lawyers to advise me that the legal basis had been changed in the recast so that we were able to make changes on that basis, otherwise it would have almost escaped our scrutiny. Fortunately, the Council was of the same opinion and at the last minute we were able to put this right in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Recasting remains a difficult issue for the work of this Parliament. ']"

491, 17. Substances that deplete the ozone layer (recast) (debate) ,"  Flaviu Călin Rus  (PPE-DE),  in writing. – (RO) In my view, we must all be concerned about the health of both the current generation and future generations. Our health is maintained through a clean environment and the atmosphere around us. All scientific studies highlight the fact that the ozone layer is extremely important not only for the population’s health, but also for sustaining life on earth.Unfortunately, there are a number of substances which, when emitted into the atmosphere, destroy the ozone layer, thereby contributing to the increase in the greenhouse effect. Although signs of ozone layer recovery have been observed as a result of the measures taken, it is considered that the level of ozone in the atmosphere prior to 1980 will only be achieved in the second half of the 21st century.Consequently, I totally agree with additional measures being taken to limit or even ban ozone-depleting substances. I believe that by taking this kind of action we are fulfilling our duty not only to the current generation but to future generations as well.
