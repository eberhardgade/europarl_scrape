15, 13. EU 2020 - Follow-up of the informal European Council of 11 February 2010 (debate) ,"  Herman Van Rompuy,  President of the European Council. – Mr President, I am delighted to have this opportunity to take part in a debate with you not only to report on the informal meeting of the Heads of State or Government of two weeks ago – it was, after all, an informal meeting, with no formal conclusions to report – but also to take this opportunity to meet with you early in my mandate. Had I waited until the first formal opportunity to report on a European Council taking place at the end of March, I would not have come before this Parliament before the end of April, some five months after my designation as President of the European Council. Let me therefore take this opportunity to lay out how I see my role and function. I shall spend a few minutes on this so as not to have to return to this on future occasions.There has, of course, always been a Presidency of the European Council; not the same thing as the ‘President of Europe’, as some media put it. So what has changed? Three small things, but which will, together and over time, have the potential to make a significant difference.First is the element of continuity: past presidents changed every six months; that is, after every second or third meeting. There was little opportunity to develop a long-term strategy. Our partners in third countries were bemused at having to meet a different Head of Government every time they had a summit with the European Union. Greater continuity is fundamental to building relationships and carrying out a serious task.Second is the full-time nature of the job; previous presidents had to simultaneously manage their own national governments. This meant that, at best, they could only deal half-time with European affairs. By creating a full-time post dedicated to the running of the European Council and its follow-up, including external representation, the European Council now has a better chance to play its role within the European institutional system.Third is the fact that Heads of State or Government now choose who they want to hold this position rather than it happening haphazardly from an arbitrary rotation system. I hope this, too, augurs well for the support that the President can count on.These three changes are all pragmatic improvements to the previous institutional architecture but, taken together with the fact that the European Council now becomes an institution in its own right, they give the European Council a better chance of fulfilling its task under the treaties of ‘[defining] the general political directions and priorities [of the Union]’.Some commentators have seen a great deal more in this role; others have seen less. On the one hand, some consider the Presidency of the European Council to be a sort of président in the manner of an executive Head of State, as in, for instance, France. Others, on the other hand, see it as the mere chairmanship of the meeting of the Heads of Government. In reality, it is neither. It is certainly not a President and not with executive powers in its own right. The incumbent must express the views of the collective Heads of State or Government. On the other hand, the role is not merely one of being a chairman, giving the floor to one or another member of the European Council to speak during its meetings. The task of preparing and then following up its meetings, and representing the Union externally – for instance, along with the President of the Commission at the G20 Summit – and the role as a bridge between the national capitals and institutions clearly go beyond the task of merely chairing meetings.The role of permanent President is to enhance a shared sense of direction: nothing more, nothing less. Where are we going? How to deal with our neighbours? Who are our main strategic partners in the world? Where do we want to be in 10 or 20 years’ time? These are vital issues.As regards my relationship with the European Parliament, the treaty is quite brief on this: it simply requires that I report to you ‘after […] meetings of the European Council’. That means a minimum of four times a year, though in most years, that is more likely to be five or six and may, in the future, rise to 10. It will not be long before many of you will be fed up with the sight of me! I will continue to multiply other usual contacts with Members of Parliament, such as the meetings I have begun with leaders of groups and the monthly meeting I have with the President of Parliament.Indeed, my role should not be confused with that of the President of the Commission. Mr Barroso chairs an executive that is elected by and is accountable to the European Parliament. It submits legislative and budgetary proposals to you, I do not do so. The Commission President has an intimate day-to-day contact with the European Parliament, not least working on those legislative and budgetary proposals. My task is, rather, to ensure that the Heads of State or Government can collectively agree on an overall strategy for the European Union, both as regards its internal development and in terms of its external relations. I have a weekly meeting with President Barroso. We are both acutely aware of the need to avoid any conflicts of competence or misunderstandings as to who is responsible for what. Public opinion and third countries may well find it difficult to grasp the difference between the President of the Commission and the President of the European Council; I am very confident that we are on the right track.In this context, it is also important to remember that I am President of the European Council and not of the Council of Ministers; these are two separate institutions. The ordinary Council, which is the other branch of the legislature with the European Parliament, will still be chaired by a Presidency that continues to rotate every six months among the Member States. Only in the configuration of foreign affairs where it coordinates executive power does it have a permanent president in the form of Catherine Ashton, Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative for Foreign Policy.I pause at this point to pay tribute to the work being done by Catherine Ashton. In facing up to multiple challenges in the field of foreign affairs and security and in preparing the External Action Service, she deserves our support. It will be my privilege to work closely with her in representing the Union externally.Let me just say a few words about the European Council itself.The first formal meeting under my chairmanship will take place at the end of next month. We did, however, have a useful informal gathering of Heads of State or Government earlier this month at the Bibliothèque Solvay, just a few hundred metres from here. Whether it was because of the more intimate surroundings of the library or the physical proximity of Parliament, our discussions were fruitful.As I said, I cannot report any formal conclusions to you from an informal meeting. At most, I can share with you my own personal conclusions from the discussions which I have set out in a letter to the members of the European Council and which I know has been circulated within Parliament. My aim with this informal Council was mainly to prepare our future deliberations on the issue of how to improve Europe’s economic performance as we exit the immediate economic crisis. This involves looking at our targets and ambitions – and we have a very useful paper from Commission President Barroso on this – but also how to improve our governance of these issues. How we go about managing our integrated European economy – the world’s largest market – in order to improve our economic performance is one of the central questions facing the European Union.Our initial exchange of views on this involved looking at how we set targets, how we follow them up, how we evaluate results. It is in large part about coordinating the exercise of national competences whilst making full use of the European Union competences and instruments available. It is therefore a task to which the European Council is eminently suited. At the Solvay meeting, all members of the European Council agreed that we need better, more focused economic coordination in the Union, both for major economic policy – certainly in the euro area – and for micro-economic policy. A lot of this is very technical, but let us just take the idea of bringing down the number of common economic objectives to concentrate on four or five. These objectives should be quantifiable and divisible in national set objectives; it makes no sense to have scoreboards on, say, 65 different sets of data.Moreover, all members of the European Council are willing to take more responsibility in a common European strategy for growth and jobs. Such personal involvement is indispensable; we need to go from paper recommendations to real-life commitment. I was glad to find such a level of ambition around the table. Whether you want to call it better coordination, better governance, or even a gouvernement économique, the key is the common commitment to success.We also had a quick discussion on how to better implement Europe’s actions in the reconstruction of Haiti; we want to take this discussion further with an eye to better implementing Article 214 of the Treaty on the coordination of humanitarian aid. A discussion on how Europe should respond strategically to the Copenhagen conference on climate change will be pursued at the next European Council. Unexpectedly, of course, there was a discussion on the situation in Greece. I took it upon myself to ensure that this was handled in the European Union’s institutional framework and not outside it, and that the agreement reached met with the approval of all 27 Heads of State or Government as well as the President of the Commission and the President of the European Central Bank. This degree of consensus was a message about Greece’s acceptance of its responsibility to cut its deficit in a credible way and of our solidarity with it if needed. I very much look forward to hearing your views on all these matters, not least on how we can face all the challenges facing our Union.I can assure you that I have one overriding goal for the coming years; to ensure that our Union is on track to be strong enough internally to maintain our own social model and externally to defend our interests and project our values. I think that all European institutions can, and must, work together for those goals.(Applause) ","Herman Van Rompuy,",20,1806,not_available,"['hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv']","['  Herman Van Rompuy,  President of the European Council. – Mr President, I am delighted to have this opportunity to take part in a debate with you not only to report on the informal meeting of the Heads of State or Government of two weeks ago – it was, after all, an informal meeting, with no formal conclusions to report – but also to take this opportunity to meet with you early in my mandate.

I took it upon myself to ensure that this was handled in the European Union’s institutional framework and not outside it, and that the agreement reached met with the approval of all 27 Heads of State or Government as well as the President of the Commission and the President of the European Central Bank. This degree of consensus was a message about Greece’s acceptance of its responsibility to cut its deficit in a credible way and of our solidarity with it if needed. I very much look forward to hearing your views on all these matters, not least on how we can face all the challenges facing our Union.', 'I can assure you that I have one overriding goal for the coming years; to ensure that our Union is on track to be strong enough internally to maintain our own social model and externally to defend our interests and project our values. I think that all European institutions can, and must, work together for those goals.', '(Applause) ']"
16, 13. EU 2020 - Follow-up of the informal European Council of 11 February 2010 (debate) ,"  José Manuel Barroso,  President of the Commission. – Mr President, let me first of all congratulate President Van Rompuy on what was a very good informal European Council for the first time under his chairmanship.After reaching agreement among all of us on an important statement on Greece, we discussed the Europe 2020 strategy – a strategy for sustainable growth and employment. I had the opportunity to focus on the substantive policy issues we are facing, on the challenges, and on the lines which the Commission will formally propose next Wednesday.Before the crisis, the European economy was making progress: we saw 18 million new jobs and a more dynamic business environment. However, these gains have been wiped out by the financial crisis and its impact on many of our areas of activity: a 4% fall in GDP in a single year, unemployment shooting up to 10%, a huge hit to our prosperity, a real threat to our societies. At the same time, the task is getting tougher: we have an ageing population, a growing productivity gap with our competitors, and failings in education and research. However, we also have many strengths: we have the world’s biggest market economy; we have the single market; we have the euro area. All this has proved to be an important asset in the crisis.But today, Europe faces a very important choice; I would say a defining choice for future generations. Hoping for a return of the good old days is no option. One option is limited change – the lowest common denominator which brings some reform and some growth. But we could never get back what we lost in the crisis. This option would result in a Europe which is second class in the new global order. Minimal changes, some kind of adaptations.I believe we can and must be more ambitious. We can aspire to an economic strategy that puts Europe on the path to competitiveness and that can create millions of new jobs. But this cannot be done by half measures and incremental change. We need to instil a sense of urgency, a recognition that business as usual will not protect our European way of life and will not defend our social models. On the contrary. Those social models will be put at risk if we do not adapt to a much more challenging global environment.This requires a joint effort. We need the Member States; we need the European institutions; we need stakeholders and society at large; and we need specifically the active involvement and support of this Parliament, the European Parliament, for shaping this strategy and for communicating it to the people.Next week, the Commission will set out the key elements of the strategy that it will formally propose to the European institutions. It will centre on three priorities: smart growth, inclusive growth, sustainable growth.First, the core driver of growth must be knowledge; knowledge and innovation that produces tomorrow’s ideas, tomorrow’s skills, tomorrow’s technologies. Second, to keep in force our European model of society, we need to deliver more jobs. Our goal must be healthy, prosperous, secure societies, where everyone feels they can play their part. That means giving people jobs and skills and it means tackling the scourge of poverty head on. The problem of poverty is not only a national problem; it is a problem for which we need a common European response.Our social market economy must be hardwired to seize the opportunities of the future. I am talking about sustainable growth, recognising the importance of tackling climate change, recognising the pressure on resources. With this, I mean a competitive economy, deepening the internal market, creating better conditions for investment – especially for SMEs – a European economy able to hold its own in a globalised market place.These priorities are not unfamiliar. But the fact that we have not yet succeeded in realising these goals makes them more important, not less. Where we need to make a radical change is not in our prescription of what the European economy needs, but in our approach on how to make it happen.What do we need in order to succeed? Firstly, the strategy must be comprehensive. We cannot have a pick-and-mix strategy allowing everyone to do the easy parts, the feel-good things, and leave the real challenges to the others. There are still many issues: when I think about completing the single market, about the quality of our taxation systems, about the way we spend money at a time of intense pressure on public finances, to name but a few.Secondly, our strategy must engage all parts of our societies. We will not succeed in putting European society on the right track for the future if this comes at the cost of social conflict. That is why a proactive approach to creating jobs and addressing the scourge of poverty are essential. It is also why we have been wise to reform financial markets. We want a strong financial sector able to finance innovation and help businesses to grow: one which acknowledges its broader responsibilities to society and governments which came to its aid at the time of need; one which accepts that effective supervision at European level is necessary today.Thirdly, we must not confuse having an overall vision for the European economy with the question of ‘who does what?’. It should not be a question of a debate on competences. What we have to see is the added value of a European approach. It is quite evident at a time of globalisation, when we need to discuss with America, with China, with Russia, with others, that there is added value in a common approach; for instance, in the G20, an initiative that was in fact launched by the European Union during the French Presidency by the President of France and myself, when we proposed to the American President to accept those summits. It is indeed necessary to recognise that we have greater influence if we act together. It makes no sense to recognise global interdependence and to reject European interdependence. That is why we need to act together.Still, a lot of action will have to come at national level. Of course, there are national responsibilities which we expect to be addressed mainly by governments, but we also expect governments to commit sincerely to a European approach. The European approach is necessary, not to bring back powers in Brussels – this is not our intention at all – but to help the indispensable reforms in our societies so that they can bring more prosperity, more well-being to our citizens.We will only succeed if we are ready to work together, not against each other, and therefore we need credible ownership at all levels. We need strong and true coordination in the economic field. The Lisbon Treaty gives us these instruments and we will use them.In this European Council, I saw awareness of this problem. I can compare the discussions this time with the discussions five years ago when we were discussing the Lisbon Strategy. Let me tell you very frankly and very openly that I saw among Heads of State or Government much more awareness of the need to act together and also of the external constraints on the European economy. I sincerely hope that this time, narrow national interests will not again resist the need for closer coordination and an effective system of European governance.We also need significant European Union level flagship measures to typify what we are trying to achieve: some concrete plans. We are going to present some of them: projects like an Innovation Plan, a new skills programme, a proper industrial policy, a digital agenda, green technologies, and a specific plan or action against poverty; projects that have a value, an impact in themselves; projects that show why Europe provides part of the solution and which show that the European Union is not just talking, it is acting.Let me finish by calling upon you, the European Parliament, to show your strong support for these projects as legislator, as budgetary authority and as champion of European action in every corner of the European Union.

17, 13. EU 2020 - Follow-up of the informal European Council of 11 February 2010 (debate) ,"  Joseph Daul,  on behalf of the PPE Group. – (FR) Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council of 11 February was the first to be convened and presided over by Mr Van Rompuy, whom I would like to welcome on his first appearance in the plenary session of the European Parliament.Mr Van Rompuy, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) expects a lot of you. I welcome the positive and pragmatic spirit of your speeches since your nomination, and I appreciate the tone that you want to set in the European Council, but I expect you and the Council of Ministers to be aware that with the Treaty of Lisbon, your relations with us, the MEPs, have changed. We are equal decision makers, and that has not only legal consequences, but political ones as well.Now I would like to come to the substance of the debates of 11 February, which is, of course, the 2020 strategy, but it is also the euro and economic and budgetary policy, since speculation against the Greek debt and the euro were certainly unexpected guests in the Solvay library.I would like to put the following question: is the weakening of our common currency solely due to the Greek crisis, or is the euro the target of direct attacks by those who are unhappy about its power and that of the Member States involved?Secondly, are we going to wait until the situation in certain euro area countries deteriorates before we react, as we did with Greece? If not, what plans are there to put things right in the countries most at risk? A question for you there, President Van Rompuy.I ask these questions because, while I am happy with the solidarity measures taken on 11 February, I seriously doubt whether we Europeans are really on top of the situation. What is the situation, if not the fact that the Greek warning has shown the extent to which we must take courageous decisions to finally make sure that our currency, the euro, reflects the political power behind it?Of course, we talk a great deal, we talk about economic governance, we also talk about monetary governance, but we could make matters a great deal simpler and certainly more effective if we devised and implemented real budgetary coordination of the euro area members. The former French Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, has himself recently recognised the need to abandon sovereignty in some areas – something that is not easy for a Frenchman – and has spoken in favour of the national budgets of the euro area States being approved by the Eurogroup even before being submitted to the national parliaments.I would like to take up this bold idea, and I ask the European Council to consider it and to analyse it seriously. By properly coordinating their budgets, the euro area States would acquire unprecedented influence and room for manoeuvre. This power would mean that they have a strong influence on the development of new global regulations, but it would also demand that the European forces unite within the international financial organisations, where the euro must speak with one voice.Let me cite a striking example – which was mentioned by Mr Barroso I believe – that of the IMF, where the voting rights are calculated according to the economic weight of the states. With these criteria, the United States enjoys 16.7% of the voting rights, Japan 6%, China 3.6% and the six founding members of the European Union 18.49%. However, if they presented a united front to the IMF, the euro area countries would represent 23% of the votes, and all the countries of the European Union, still united, would represent 32% of the votes, that is to say, twice as many as the United States.Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, that is the reality of the balance of power in the world. However, because it is still divided, Europe is unable to punch its full weight. Can we tolerate this any more? The PPE Group does not think so. It is time, President Van Rompuy, for the euro area countries to open their eyes to this state of affairs and to learn from it. They would then be prepared for what they will soon have to do out of necessity, namely, truly unite instead of clinging to this facade of economic sovereignty, which is nothing but a dangerous pretence.

18, 13. EU 2020 - Follow-up of the informal European Council of 11 February 2010 (debate) ,"  Stephen Hughes,  on behalf of the S&D Group. – Mr President, since the start of the economic and social crisis, over seven million people have joined the unemployment lines in Europe. By the end of this year, it is quite likely that over 25 million people will be unemployed. The good health of our economies and public finances, which we have striven so hard to put in order since the early 1990s, has been ruined in less than two years. Despite costly recovery measures, all we have managed to avoid so far is a complete collapse of the system.Economic growth remains extremely weak, and many people have lost faith in the idea of an early recovery. Fears for the future trouble our societies, inequalities of all kinds have widened and some of our Member States are in desperate need of EU-wide solidarity and protection, having become the targets of ruthless and uncontrolled speculation. The crisis has gravely undermined Europe’s global competitiveness and weakened its political influence.That is the gloomy landscape in which Europe now needs to reinvent its future in order to safeguard its model of economic and social development.President Barroso, you are going to be asking the Spring Council where we want Europe to be in 2020. That is a very important question, but can we afford to argue about the distant future without first providing an answer to those millions of Europeans who are now feeling the impact of the crisis on their lives and who worry what will happen to their lives tomorrow – will they have a job; will they have the prospect of finding a new job? What answers can you give them?I cannot go back to my region tomorrow and tell my people that they do not need to worry, that we have a plan for 2020. I need to answer their immediate worries and fears, and I want to be able to tell them that they will be able to keep their jobs, that new jobs will soon start to be created and that these jobs will be decent jobs with decent salaries.At the moment, the only medium-term policy agenda is that set down by the European Council in December: the consolidation of public finances. By 2011, Member States are expected to start consolidation to bring their public deficits within the 3% limit within two years. At the same time, unemployment will still be rising; growth will be too weak to bring unemployment down.There are other ways to pull Europe out of the crisis: putting people at the heart of our policy agenda and especially those who have been most hit by the crisis. I would urge President Van Rompuy and President Barroso to reconsider the nature of the so-called exit strategy. Europe should choose a morally decent way out of this crisis: a human way based on our fundamental values – which actually is also a smarter way in economic terms.This will not be the case if macro-economic policy is totally focused on rapid consolidation. That would mean cuts in public investment, in education and training, in social and in health services. Consolidation cannot be achieved through tax rises alone. Europe’s growth potential would suffer even more than it already has and, as a result, the recovery would be extremely slow and a large share of the current unemployed would become long-term unemployed.Europeans deserve a more balanced and socially responsible policy approach. We believe this approach should involve an ‘entry strategy’ into the labour market, which should form an integral part of the 2020 strategy and constitute its roadmap for the years up to 2015.It should combine the macro-economic policy agenda with structural policies in the economic, social and environmental fields to aim at the creation of at least five million net new jobs by 2015, particularly in the green economy. The European Council should state this intention clearly at the March summit as a key objective of the new strategy.Proper economic policy coordination reaching well beyond the policing role of the stability pact should ensure that gradual fiscal consolidation in the different Member States is combined with the preservation of key public spending in growth areas and key social policies.This will demand a political leap in thinking with regard to Europe’s – and, in particular, the eurozone’s – economic governance.The March or June summit should give a mandate to its president, in close cooperation with the Commission, to submit an ambitious plan for the strengthening of economic governance in the EU for decision by the December 2010 Council.We need to challenge the old way of doing things if we want to learn lessons from the current crisis and make it history as soon as possible. This is a chance to make Europe relevant to people and not just to markets. This can only become a reality if the 2020 strategy is indeed about people and about jobs – in other words, if it incorporates an ambitious social and decent-jobs agenda.In the name of my group, I urge you to do all you can to put people, and not least, the most vulnerable people, at the heart of the European project.

19, 13. EU 2020 - Follow-up of the informal European Council of 11 February 2010 (debate) ,"  Guy Verhofstadt,  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, first of all, let me come directly to what I would call the most urgent problem today. We can talk about 2020, but we have a more urgent problem today: the eurozone and Greece. We have to find solutions to that.I think we, the European Parliament, have to take the initiative in this field. It is important to determine what exactly happened in Greece. Today, we received contradictory information. Greece says that it has given all the information to the European Union and European institutions. At the same time, the European Commission and Eurostat are saying that they did not receive all the necessary information. At the same time the investment banks – Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank – are minimising what they have done in the Greece case.I therefore think it is the task of this Parliament to organise hearings with the relevant committee as quickly as possible, so that we can hear all the parties concerned on this matter and find out exactly what is happening in the case of Greece. We cannot talk about remedies, about solutions, about reforms in the European Union if, first of all, we do not know what really happened in the case of Greece in 2008 and 2009 and before that, and I think it is absolutely necessary that the different parties are heard by this Parliament.The second point is that we also have to tackle the problem of the Greek debt. I think there is only one good solution to that. Yesterday, I read the article by George Soros in the Financial Times on the matter, and a few days ago I read the article by Joschka Fischer in the German press. He is saying what many people are saying: the best solution to the Greek debt is a European solution – euro obligations, or a European monetary fund, without any costs to the European taxpayer, but with a solution for the future. I think it is also the task of this Parliament to ask the Commission and the Council to reflect on that possibility and to go beyond the national interests of the current Member States of the European Union to examine this possibility.Thirdly, I think the most important part of this debate is, naturally, what to do about 2020. I think Greece is a very good example of what went wrong with the Lisbon Strategy. The Lisbon Strategy was too weak; the gap between the German economy and the Greek economy widened over the last 10 years: it became bigger, not smaller, after the Lisbon Strategy. What we need – and it is the first decision to be taken by the Commission and the European Council – is to recognise that the open coordination method was not a good method; it was too weak a method. We need a bolder instrument inside the European Union. This bolder instrument is economic governance inside the European Union.Mr Barroso, I hope that in a few days’ time, at the beginning of March – I think it is 3 March – you come forward with a paper on this. I hope it will include a bolder strategy than the things that were concluded or not concluded at the informal summit. It is still an intergovernmental, open-coordination method. They make it a little bit better, a little bit faster, but at the end, it continues to be an open coordination method based on intergovernmentalism. What we ask from you is to take the lead on that, on this economic policy and on this economic governance, and to come forward, together with Olli Rehn, with a bold proposal to have economic governance inside the European Union. It is nonsense to have monetary union on the one hand and not to have an economic and social and political union on the other. The problems with Greece are proof of that.(Applause)I think this is a time when we can expect something bold from the Commission, and I hope that on 3 March, the Commission will propose a document that is far more ambitious than the – in my view – disappointing conclusions of the informal summit.(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) ","Guy Verhofstadt,",9,712,not_available,"['hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv']","['  Guy Verhofstadt,  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, first of all, let me come directly to what I would call the most urgent problem today.

I believe that what is least helpful in the dispute over the situation in, and the prospects for, Greece is an anti-Greek, nationalistic or anti-European attitude. In my opinion, mistakes that have been made for a long time are now being revealed in Greece – often, more comes to light in a crisis than in good times.I would like to pick up on an issue raised by Mr Verhofstadt. If we do not want anti-European developments, we need to discuss who in Brussels is responsible for allowing these things to be concealed in Greece for so many years – probably even during the entire preparatory period for the monetary union. Mr Barroso, I believe that you have a crucial share of the responsibility in this regard. This, in particular, is something that you need to disclose, because as yet, we have only seen the tip of the iceberg in terms of responsibility and we have not seen the system of irresponsibility that lies beneath it.Secondly, a lot needs to change in Greece, too. We need to have a – preferably friendly – discussion with Greece about this within the euro area. If this help is necessary – which I think it will be – and if European solidarity needs to be employed once again – and I would not want to rule it out in any way at this point – then Greece needs to make some real changes. There is the excessive public sector, for example. If I am to believe the Greeks with whom I have spoken, 25% of Greek workers are employed in the public sector, and it is not even a good public sector. It is definitely in need of reform.However, it is not only in terms of expenditure that changes need to be made, as there is clearly something very wrong with the revenue side as well. I think that Mr Papandreou has the right idea with his intention to publish the tax declarations of the high earners in Greece. It is not necessary to buy CDs from Switzerland; there is another way to go about this. This will very quickly shed light on the fact that, in Greece too, the revenue can be considerably improved if tax evasion is ultimately prevented and the people in Greece who are living in the lap of luxury pay their taxes like decent citizens.My colleague, Mr Giegold, will probably talk more about the Eurobonds later.

We are very grateful for the advice and I hope my colleagues and I will be able to remedy that in the forthcoming general election.Even before the recent crisis, the economies of Europe were losing ground to our major rivals and competitors. Our growth level was less, our unemployment higher, our relative trading position was in decline and our share of global output falling. We had launched the Lisbon Strategy, but without enough conviction or commitment; unsurprisingly, it has not succeeded. Europe 2020 must not go the same way. I am very pleased that my group was among the first to submit proposals to help with its progress.We now need to set a new course for our economies. We must recognise that governments do not create productive jobs or raise living standards. Only competitive business and successful entrepreneurs can do that. Our Member States and the institutions of the European Union then need to support them by reducing the burdens they face. We cannot expect to have dynamic economies if we make even greater demands on those who are generating growth and jobs by imposing heavy tax regimes and bureaucratic regulations. We need to encourage more research and development, improved higher education and better vocational training, as President Barroso has just emphasised. The internal market needs to be reinvigorated and extended to new fields.The stakes could not be higher. For almost three centuries, the strongest economic powers in the world have also been those with the most liberal and the most democratic constitutions; the cause of freedom and economic prosperity have marched together. We are now entering a new era. By the end of this century, considerable economic power may have shifted to states with undemocratic governments.

There are 27 governments in the European Union trying – each in its own way – to rescue their own banks and large-scale industries. This has so far resulted in more debt for each individual country and catastrophic savings rates for citizens. The euphemistic wage restraint policy, reducing non-wage labour costs and the privatisation of life risks such as age, family, sickness and desired education have all been mentioned.The banks are now using the state rescue packages to speculate against the national budgets. The banks have already made more progress than the states. Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank, which, in Germany, were rescued using billions of euros of taxpayers’ money, are right at the forefront when it comes to the business of excessively expensive government bonds in Greece. Taxpayers’ money is being used for speculation and this is money from normal, honest wage earners who do not have Swiss bank accounts like those to which the richer people are fleeing.(Heckling)Believe me, I find no pleasure in using negative examples from Germany. However, one governing party in Germany is constantly calling for tax relief, while at the same time, the Greek Government is being called on to increase taxes. Who will have to find this money, though? I fear that it will primarily be those who are already finding it hard to make ends meet. Was it not Germany, formerly the world’s highest exporter, that years ago separated wage increases from productivity, thus resulting in social dumping?In ancient Greek theatre, a crisis means an opportunity – yes, the challenge of a turning point.

In the current economic context, we could describe the country of Belgium as the Greece of the North Sea without any exaggeration whatsoever because this country, Belgium, has, after Greece and Italy, the largest government debt in percentage terms in the whole of Europe. Fundamentally, we are a sick country in Europe and, if I can put it this way, that is in no way a credit to one of the previous speakers, Mr Verhofstadt, former Prime Minister of Belgium. When it comes to fraud and artificially inflating the budget, he could even teach the Greeks a thing or two!However, let us not get too worked up about that. In particular, let us not claim that we will be able to avert the crisis by running up a higher government debt, the infamous Verhofstadt proposal for a European government loan, which is a bill that somebody will have to foot sooner or later. On the contrary, we have seen, time and again, that it is European decisions that have led us into the crisis, European decisions to throw the Maastricht criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact out of the window all for the sake of appearances, because Europe had to be seen to move forward.It is also that same Eurocrat obstinacy which is now ramming Turkey’s accession strategy down our throats. The economic and geographical reality must now be pushed to one side and European citizens have to pay through the nose for the potential accession of a country which is not even European.

Ambitious, firstly, as regards the reduction of our ecological footprint. Therefore, this is not just about the climate and, from that point of view, returning to the 20% figure is, in our view, far below what is really required. Not even 30% is ambitious.Next, an ambitious goal concerning the reduction in inequalities: for example, reducing the level of poverty in Europe by 50% by 2020; that certainly would not be a maximum to achieve. An ambitious goal with regard to education, research, development and innovation, and, of course, an ambitious goal with regard to job creation.These goals, as has already been mentioned, must be measurable and must be binding; whether it is a bonus-malus system or something else matters little, but we need results. However, we will not achieve these results without two absolutely vital ingredients.The first ingredient is strong market regulations and, from that point of view, Mr Van Rompuy, the developments with regard to financial market supervision and the positions adopted by the Council worry us greatly.As regards the second ingredient, I would like to stress what Mr Daul said.

Therefore, we are less able to revive our growth.', 'How do we solve this dilemma? This is the question I put to you. It depends on two elements. Firstly, what are the guidelines that you will defend when discussing the budgetary perspectives with the Member States? Secondly, are you able to move towards innovations that will allow the European Investment Bank and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development alike to assume much greater responsibility and – why not? – to enable Europe to borrow to finance this necessity, which is the growth of tomorrow?

Is it a simple name change or a change of direction? I address this in particular to Mr Barroso. While reading your contribution to the informal Council, while hearing you talk today quite rightly of the number of poor in the European Union and of the need to develop financial regulation, I said to myself, Mr Barroso, that it is a pity that you were not a proper President of the Commission over the last few years! Then you would have been able to do everything that you are proposing to us today. Today, you say that it is the crisis that prevented you from doing it, but it is easy to blame the crisis. In the end, every sin can be forgiven, so let us not waste any more time.I turn therefore with hope to Mr Van Rompuy, firstly to offer him a warmer welcome than the one he was offered previously by one of the other Members – not by the others. It is you we are counting on. It is slightly paradoxical, Mr Van Rompuy, but we are counting on you to relaunch Europe, a proper European community, and you come from a country which knows what the word ‘community’ means in terms of the general interest.If you tackle this, you will have the support of this Parliament, and I believe that, as far as the 2020 strategy is concerned, we must not let ourselves be misled by words. If words mean anything, we must, above all, think medium term, think global and think beyond nationalism. I agree with what Mr Lamberts said: right now, the Members of the Council are not giving us a great European perspective on financial supervision. They have both feet on the brakes.For my part, I therefore propose a single goal, which you actually mention in your own paper for the Council, and that is to have an Economic and Monetary Union in all its forms, to consolidate disciplines and, of course, to consolidate solidarity.

Your duty is to give meaning to it, to set the course, to convince the European Council that Europe is not a problem, but a solution. Europe does not expose, it protects.

Concerning the institution: we have to decide to whom this strategy is addressed. If it is addressed to EU leaders, then what has been done until now is adequate and the tight schedule is a good thing. However, if we think it is addressed to the citizens of the EU, whom we want to win over to our side, whom we want to work with and not against in shaping a stronger, more competitive Union that delivers more benefits to citizens than it does now, then we must proceed in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon and honestly involve the European Parliament and, what is more, national parliaments as well.

We are also very much encouraged by the sense of urgency in the European Council where it is very clear that the atmosphere today is very different from that of five years ago when we were discussing the parameters of the Lisbon Strategy.But we need to do more; we need to get local and regional support for this strategy and, most importantly, we need to get the people behind it.

We would like to focus more on education and training, so that the labour force in Europe will maintain the competitive edge which Europe deserves.

70, 13. EU 2020 - Follow-up of the informal European Council of 11 February 2010 (debate) ,"  Herman Van Rompuy,  President of the European Council. – (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that we have had this debate; I am glad that I accepted your invitation to come here, at the very beginning of the process of the 2020 strategy, because the debate has only just begun. We had a debate just recently, on 11 February, we will have a spring Council at the end of March, and we will finalise the 2020 strategy, or the strategy for employment and economic growth, at the end of June. We therefore have a considerable amount of time in which to exchange views and determine the course of action once and for all.I therefore welcome this European ambition that I have found here this afternoon, and I welcome this sense of urgency that I have encountered this afternoon. There was one speech for which I have nothing but contempt, but I am not going to comment on that further.As far as the economic strategy is concerned, I will make a distinction between three periods. The first period is the period that we are still in now, in other words, the financial crisis and all its consequences. Allow me to use a different language from what I have heard this afternoon throughout the entire debate. I will explain. I would like to use a language that also reflects what is positive about the European Union, because surprising though it may seem, there are also positive things that have happened recently. We have drawn consequences and learnt lessons from the crisis of the 1930s. We now find ourselves one year on from the major crisis and, in fact, in 2010, we now have positive growth in most countries once more. That did not happen during the 1930s. The crisis actually lasted until the end of the decade.Why do we have this positive growth now? Because we have taken measures. We have taken measures to save the financial institutions, not because we particularly like them as such, but because, without them, there is no economy. We have conducted an intelligent monetary policy. We have injected liquidity into the economy, something that no one did 70 years ago. For at least 16 countries, we have created a zone of monetary stability, in spite of all the problems. In the 1930s, we had competitive devaluations. We have not had them today. We have conducted a risky budgetary policy using budgetary deficits to stimulate the economy. We did not do what was done in the 1930s, namely restore budgetary equilibrium as quickly as possible. Therefore, we have protected our internal market, which is not perfect. We must improve it, and Mr Monti will provide us with some concrete proposals. However, we have not lapsed back into the protectionism of the 1930s. Therefore, we have learnt some lessons from the major crisis that we have just experienced.I would even go a step further. It is thanks to the European Union that the G20 was born; we were the ones who took the initiative to create this embryonic world governance. It is the first time that the big powers, new and old, have come together to combat the crisis, in an imperfect way, but we will continue to work along these lines. So Europe, the European Union, should not always be put on the defensive. There are also some very positive things that have been produced.Now we must leave this strategy, this so-called exit strategy, behind. We have to find a balance between abandoning the budgetary stimuli too quickly and returning, in the medium term, to budgetary equilibrium, which is absolutely necessary to fund our pension system, our social security system and our health care system. So it is a difficult balance that we have to find, and the Stability and Growth Pact provides us with the means to do it, because it does not require an immediate return to budgetary equilibrium. It requires a step-by-step approach, whereby we first reach a stage of 3% and then, in the medium term, budgetary equilibrium. I think that we have conducted and we are continuing to conduct a wise policy.As far as the Lisbon Strategy is concerned, we know its handicaps, but we must not forget either that the financial and economic crisis has completely disrupted the implementation of the Lisbon agenda. There have, of course, been omissions; I am not going to list them here, they are well known. I will say this, however: we need some major reforms, or important reforms, and these important reforms, at European level and nationally, will demand budgetary choices. It is not by chance – and I have repeated this in the written conclusions that you have read – that we want to link the budgetary discussion, effectively in its legal framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, to economic reforms. This is because, if we say that we need to do more research and development, for example, then we must make provision for that in the national budgets and in the European Union’s financial perspective. That means that some budgetary choices will need to be made.Another consequence of the choices we are making for the Lisbon Strategy is that the goals that we are proposing will not always be soft goals. It so happens that they could be hard goals. This is where it gets difficult. There is, on the one hand, the demand for reforms and, on the other, the implementation of the reforms. I do not say that I have heard it here, but outside this House, at European level, people are demanding hard measures, major reforms, hard reforms, and when people go back to their countries, I see few results of all that. We therefore need a consistent position. It is not just the European Union that will implement reforms. We can encourage them, stimulate them and provide the right framework for them, but it is at national level that a large number of reforms will have to be made, and therefore, it is a matter of demonstrating significant political will, and political commitment is the most important thing.It is often said that we need more binding measures. However, we should think about this. I have made quite a few proposals, which I believe are more intelligent than binding measures. However, even the Stability and Growth Pact, which contains many binding measures, has failed to put some countries back on track. Therefore, the method is not everything, the method does not resolve everything, and without political engagement, without commitment, the method is worthless.As for the economic strategy, it is all very well for some to say that we need more constraints. However, as far as economic guidelines are concerned, the Treaty of Lisbon does not make provision for that. I myself did not draw up the Treaty of Lisbon, others did, but it does not provide for any sanctions, penalties, or negative measures as regards the implementation of the economic guidelines. Take a close look at Article 121 so that you are fully aware of this. Political commitment at both European and national level is therefore crucial, and without this political commitment, nothing will be done.One final word about Greece. I believe that we have sent out the right message. We have conveyed the message of the responsibility of the Greek Government, which must handle an extremely difficult situation, a situation that it inherited. It is taking some brave measures. On 11 February, it told us that if the current measures are not enough to achieve a reduction in the deficit of 4% of GDP in 2010, it would take additional measures. We have made a commitment to carry out more monitoring, not only on the initiative of the European Commission, but also with the help of the European Central Bank and even of experts from the International Monetary Fund. I therefore believe that we really have framed and defined very clearly the aspect of responsibility. If necessary, there is, of course, an element of solidarity. Greece has said that it does not want to use that, but we have provided for two messages: a message of responsibility and a message of solidarity, if necessary.Naturally, we must draw conclusions from what has happened in Greece in recent years. In the euro area too, we must be more proactive with regard to both data collection and politics itself. This crisis was also a challenge, a challenge in the sense that we must practise the policy of coordination more. In fact, every crisis is a challenge. We must learn lessons from every crisis. Well, we will learn them. In the same way as we learnt lessons from the crisis of the 1930s, we must now also learn lessons from the financial crisis: more regulation, more monitoring of bonuses, a more far-reaching banking policy. However, we must also learn all the lessons from the experience of Greece and others.Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that I have felt the same ambition in this House; I have felt the same political will to pursue an economic policy and strategy which can cope with the difficulties that we face today. As many of you have said, this is not just the responsibility of one or two people; all the European institutions and all the Member States must assume collective responsibility. Otherwise, we will not save our social model; otherwise, we will lose our position in the world.

We have followed the debates on this topic and seen that attention has been focused on the measures for exiting the crisis and reviving economic growth financially. It is undoubtedly a good idea to tackle the problems in order of severity. However, it is important for us to realise that the situation is no longer the same as it was prior to the crisis. It is actually the economic model which needs to change. It must be based more on innovation and non-polluting energy sources, and focus on people’s state of health. We cannot have a dynamic economy unless we have motivated workers. We cannot have a sustainable economy either if we support environmental protection only with half-measures. I believe that in order to restore the potential for economic growth, we need to start with changing the economic model itself, which must focus on what generates innovation and personal motivation.

The 2020 initiative, which constitutes one of the mainstays of the Spanish-Belgian-Hungarian Trio Presidency, has to respond to the long-term demographic and social challenges facing the continent. This means no less than a rethinking of the European labour market and educational system. In the face of the failure of the present European Employment Strategy, the 2020 programme must indeed create more and better jobs, with primary consideration given to the increased participation of women and disadvantaged groups in the labour market. It is commendable that both the European Commission’s agenda and the action plan of the incoming Trio Presidency place emphasis on factors indispensable to the programme’s success, such as measures targeting undeclared work, the black economy and early school leavers, as well as improving self-employment conditions. Since socio-economic exclusion is the result of numerous interdependent factors, solutions may come only from a more comprehensive action plan addressing all areas together, rather than from the project-based ideas that have hitherto prevailed. In order to be successful, isolated initiatives must be abandoned in favour of measures that are woven into a balanced policy package that focuses on early interventions and can ensure genuine improvement in each of the true measures of social exclusion reflected in the Laeken indicators.

It has taken the challenges that the European Union has to tackle during these sessions of the Human Rights Council very seriously. Proof of this is that the First Deputy Prime Minster of the Spanish Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega – in this case acting as the representative of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union – will be attending the ‘High-level segment’, which is going to begin the Council’s 13th session.The Presidency is therefore going to have an active presence in the work of the Council.We will defend the European Union’s positions on matters with special implications for numerous Member States and, in addition to the national initiatives, the European Union is going to table country resolutions.We continue to believe that the Council needs to have instruments in order to defend human rights, in order to respond to situations of serious human rights violations, either through a specific country mandate – which is the case of Burma or the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea – or through mandates on specific subjects within a country, as we hope will be the case for the Democratic Republic of Congo.These situations need to be monitored by the international community and by the Human Rights Council if we want the Council to maintain its credibility.One of the items that are going to be on the agenda for the Council’s forthcoming sessions is something that we are going to discuss later, in another item this afternoon, which is the special sessions on Gaza and the Goldstone report. The European Union considers – as we will say once again later – that this report is a reliable analysis, and the European Union stressed the importance of conducting adequate, reliable research into the possible violations of international human rights legislation and international humanitarian law.Finally, I would like to discuss the problem of the Council Review.This is going to be a crucial year for the negotiations on the review of the Council’s work, which is going to take place specifically in 2011.The European Union is beginning to work on, but intends to consolidate, a clear position, a clear strategy for the Union so that we can maintain an active role and a commitment to the protection of and respect for human rights.In any case, it is clear that the European Union is going to continue to advocate the independence of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, as it always has done, along with the independence of special procedures, the participation of non-governmental organisations in the Human Rights Council, the capacity of the Council to tackle key serious human rights violations, and the establishment of country mandates.Spain, and the Spanish Presidency, are aware that it has taken over the rotating Presidency at a crucial time for the Union and for the United Nations in terms of protecting and promoting human rights in the world.The Treaty of Lisbon has also opened up a new phase, as it has in so many other areas, in terms of the Union’s external action, and we hope that our joint work, under the leadership of the High Representative, will therefore make the European Union’s voice clearer in defending the fundamental principles of the work of the Human Rights Council. We also hope that this phase of moving towards a more active, transparent and efficient Council benefits from the transitional phase that the Union is going through under a Presidency – which I currently represent – which will do everything in its power to ensure that the paths taken by the Union and by the Council from now on lead to the same goal, which is the promotion and protection of human rights in the world.

The EU and the group of Latin American countries are jointly working on a draft resolution on the rights of the child, with a specific focus on the fight against sexual violence against children. The Commission is very concerned at the increase in sexual violence in zones of conflict and crisis situations and the spillover on the most vulnerable, especially children. The EU will, in accordance with the European consensus on humanitarian aid, ensure that this is properly addressed in the resolution.The EU would also actively participate in a panel on the rights of persons with disabilities. There is a very clear link with our EU internal policies, as we will soon conclude the accession process to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.Another thematic area of particular interest is the right to food, which is consistent with the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, as well as the human rights of internally displaced persons who, unlike refugees, are not adequately protected by international conventions, and we will press on in connection with this point.The second remark I would like to make concerns the support from the EU for the adoption by the plenary of the reports of the Universal Periodic Reviews concerning states that went through this process in December. This is a very important moment, in which the states reviewed can make public the commitments that they make for the improvement of the human rights situation. At the same time, states may choose to request international assistance for the implementation of these commitments. The Commission continues to remain very open to discussing with partners ways and means to support the implementation of the recommendations of these reviews.Very critical, as already stressed by the Spanish Presidency, is the fact that the impact of this process depends, first and foremost, on the transparency and openness displayed by EU Member States, because we can only be effective by leading by our own example.

108," 16. Parliament’s priorities for the UN Human Rights Council (Geneva, 1-26 March 2010) (continuation of debate) ","  Diego López Garrido,  President-in-Office of the Council. – (ES) Mr President, I am grateful for the speeches by Members regarding this absolutely essential and crucial issue, which, as I said in my first speech, is one of the core elements of the European Union: defending human rights.In this respect, we believe that participation in the United Nations Human Rights Council, including support for the existence of the Council, is a position that must be upheld by the European Union. The European Union has always advocated that a Human Rights Council should be established to replace the former Commission, as I said before. Furthermore, it has believed that it should be an instrument that can adequately deal with human rights situations worldwide, situations which require the United Nations and its members to take action, adopt a position or make the corresponding declaration.In fact, the Presidency of the European Union, the Presidency of the Council, has always systematically taken part in the discussions at the various part-sessions of the Human Rights Council on behalf of the European Union, and this will continue to be the case. The Presidency of the Council of the Union will take part in the next part-session of the Human Rights Council on behalf of the Council of the Union. Naturally, this is perfectly compatible with the declarations and positions of each of the Member States of the Union and of the European Commission, as another institution of the Union.I therefore would like to say that we are in favour of the existence of this body, and in favour of drawing on all of its potential, which, in some cases, is achieved, and in other cases is not: obviously, there are certain situations in which, as a result of the votes that take place, the European Union and its Member States do not achieve all their objectives. There are really positive cases, for example, the position on Somalia: there are violations of human rights in that region. There are other cases in which the objectives have not been achieved, but the positives always outweigh the negatives.I would like to say that we are going to talk about some of the cases of countries that have been mentioned in the various speeches.I do wish to talk about the case of Iran, because there have been repeated allusions to the subject of Iran’s candidacy. As you know, declarations have constantly been made on this subject. Here in front of me, I have three declarations made this year alone by the Union’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, regarding the situation in Iran, condemning and expressing her concern about cases of human rights violations and executions that have taken place in Iran.Regarding the question of the candidacy, we first have to say that this is a matter that is currently still one of national competence (the position regarding candidacies of countries to join the Human Rights Council). In any case, the matter of the human rights situation in Iran and the human rights violations, and therefore the question as to whether or not Iran’s candidacy for the Human Rights Council will be accepted, must be managed carefully in order not to cause the opposite of the desired effect. We therefore understand that the European Union, here, must try to have the most coordinated position possible (which is what is happening at the moment), while respecting national competence and, as I said, exercising caution.In short, Mr President, we consider the Human Rights Council to be a place where we must defend the European Union’s position, and we think it is the right place to do so. Furthermore, our commitment to it has always been to ensure that it does not cause the universal movement defending human rights to take steps backwards, to regress, especially in terms of humanity’s achievement, which is considering human rights to be a universal value, a universal value that should be defended over and above borders, traditions and diversity, because it is something that is linked to the very essence of human beings.

The European Union has always advocated that a Human Rights Council should be established to replace the former Commission, as I said before. Furthermore, it has believed that it should be an instrument that can adequately deal with human rights situations worldwide, situations which require the United Nations and its members to take action, adopt a position or make the corresponding declaration.', 'In fact, the Presidency of the European Union, the Presidency of the Council, has always systematically taken part in the discussions at the various part-sessions of the Human Rights Council on behalf of the European Union, and this will continue to be the case. The Presidency of the Council of the Union will take part in the next part-session of the Human Rights Council on behalf of the Council of the Union. Naturally, this is perfectly compatible with the declarations and positions of each of the Member States of the Union and of the European Commission, as another institution of the Union.', 'I therefore would like to say that we are in favour of the existence of this body, and in favour of drawing on all of its potential, which, in some cases, is achieved, and in other cases is not: obviously, there are certain situations in which, as a result of the votes that take place, the European Union and its Member States do not achieve all their objectives. There are really positive cases, for example, the position on Somalia: there are violations of human rights in that region. There are other cases in which the objectives have not been achieved, but the positives always outweigh the negatives.', 'I would like to say that we are going to talk about some of the cases of countries that have been mentioned in the various speeches.', 'I do wish to talk about the case of Iran, because there have been repeated allusions to the subject of Iran’s candidacy. As you know, declarations have constantly been made on this subject. Here in front of me, I have three declarations made this year alone by the Union’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, regarding the situation in Iran, condemning and expressing her concern about cases of human rights violations and executions that have taken place in Iran.', 'Regarding the question of the candidacy, we first have to say that this is a matter that is currently still one of national competence (the position regarding candidacies of countries to join the Human Rights Council).

Secondly, the European Union stresses the importance of adequate and credible investigations being conducted into the possible violations of international law by the parties to the conflict, in line with international legislation and therefore ensuring that the mission directs its recommendations to both the Israelis and the Palestinians.The European Union confirmed its constructive position with regard to the Goldstone report when, in the debate of the United Nations Security Council on 27 January, just one month ago, it highlighted the importance of conducting adequate and credible investigations into the possible violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. I can inform you that, subsequently, on 4 February 2010, a few days ago, the Secretary-General of the United Nations published a report on the application of the United Nations General Assembly’s Goldstone Resolution.The Secretary-General relayed the responses of Israel, the Palestinian occupied territories and Switzerland, and in his observations, he said that the processes initiated by these three parties were under way and that no opinion could be given on the application of the Resolution by the parties concerned.It remains to be seen how this matter is going to be dealt with in the United Nations General Assembly.The Spanish Presidency’s priority in this respect is to achieve a consensus regarding the Union’s position on the draft resolution that the Palestinian authorities want to submit to the United Nations General Assembly at this time.We have two objectives: firstly, we want the resolution to be adopted by consensus, and, if not, we want a European Union position to emerge on this that is as integrated as possible.In any case, I repeat that the Presidency of the Council endorses what the Goldstone report asked for, which is for credible, investigations to be conducted that are independent of the parties.

Although the EU has not endorsed all the recommendations, it made it clear that it takes the Goldstone report very seriously. It has invited all parties of the conflict to launch investigations into alleged violations – caused by parties of the conflict – of international humanitarian law and international human rights law. This investigation should be in accordance with international standards.So far, the steps taken by Israel, the Palestinian authorities and Hamas fall short of providing tangible results, and yet accountability must be established. Therefore, the EU keeps repeating our key message that the parties to the conflict make substantial efforts in conducting independent and credible investigations into the alleged violations. Since this directly concerns my responsibilities, it is worth recalling that the Commission provides substantial funding to humanitarian organisations whose projects aim to provide vital assistance and protection to Palestinian civilians.The EU will strive to ensure that the appropriate follow-up is given at the Human Rights Council meeting in March and to engage at an early stage in the preparation of a consensual resolution. In this context, I would like to state here that on 18 February, the Palestinian Delegation tabled a draft General Assembly resolution further to the United Nations’ Secretary-General’s report as a follow-up to the Goldstone report.

That mandate is, or was, the following: ‘To investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, whether before, during or after.’ And that is exactly what the Goldstone report has done – although it was not just Mr Goldstone, it was also his two female colleagues.They conducted investigations on what happened in Gaza and came up with conclusions that are disturbing to say the least. They are extremely disturbing because they find in most of the instances they looked into that breaches of international law and international humanitarian law and breaches of the Geneva Conventions have indeed been committed by the forces of a state that claims to be the sole democratic state in the region. That is indeed very disquieting.We should not let it pass. So when we are called upon to take a position on this report, the question is not whether we are for or against Israel, for or against the Palestinians, for or against Hamas; the question is whether we condone breaches of international law, of international humanitarian law and of the Geneva Conventions, no matter by whom they were committed.

That mandate is, or was, the following: ‘To investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, whether before, during or after.’ And that is exactly what the Goldstone report has done – although it was not just Mr Goldstone, it was also his two female colleagues.', 'They conducted investigations on what happened in Gaza and came up with conclusions that are disturbing to say the least. They are extremely disturbing because they find in most of the instances they looked into that breaches of international law and international humanitarian law and breaches of the Geneva Conventions have indeed been committed by the forces of a state that claims to be the sole democratic state in the region. That is indeed very disquieting.', 'We should not let it pass. So when we are called upon to take a position on this report, the question is not whether we are for or against Israel, for or against the Palestinians, for or against Hamas; the question is whether we condone breaches of international law, of international humanitarian law and of the Geneva Conventions, no matter by whom they were committed. That is what we need to answer. ']"

It is quite unacceptable that the Council still has not endorsed the recommendations of the Goldstone report. The Commission says it is taking it very seriously, but that is not good enough: we want an explicit endorsement. The Presidency says that it backs it: well, it should back it publicly and explicitly and make sure that the rest of the Council does as well.Against that backdrop, I have to say I am pleased that in Parliament’s motion for a resolution on the Human Rights Council, which we will vote on tomorrow, we have two very strong paragraphs calling on the High Representative and on Member States to publicly demand the implementation of the report’s recommendations.The resolution further calls on them to actively monitor the implementation of the recommendations for consultation of EU external missions and with NGOs in the field, because the evidence we have so far is that neither the Israeli authorities nor Hamas are taking their responsibilities sufficiently seriously. In Israel, the investigations into targets and tactics used during Operation Cast Lead have been carried out by army commanders or military police, severely compromising the independence of the findings, and from the Hamas side there is still a failure to address adequately the firing of rockets into southern Israel. In the light of these failures, it is clear that the EU should put pressure on the UN Secretary-General to prepare a genuinely independent assessment.Finally, given the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, I call again on the Council and the High Representative to put far more pressure on Israel to lift the siege which is preventing reconstruction and exacerbating the suffering.

This is a very serious accusation, which appears to overlook certain undeniable facts, such as the distribution of leaflets throughout the battle zone to explain that houses containing weapons and munitions could be hit, and the telephone and radio warnings, including on Hamas frequencies, before attacks were launched on buildings identified as arms depots.The so-called ‘roof knocking’ technique was also used: if, after all those warnings, the air force still identified buildings full of people, small explosive and, above all, loud, charges would be launched to quickly evacuate the buildings.The Israeli army introduced warning signals for the Gaza civilians that no one else had put into practice before. Anyone who uses all these precautions cannot, under any circumstances, be accused of deliberately targeting civilians.Yesterday, on the same day, I met two major political figures: the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, Avigdor Lieberman, in the morning, and the President of the Palestinian National Authority, Abu Mazen, in the evening.

For that reason, we call for an investigation and for atonement.', 'Taking a relativistic attitude to the violation of humanitarian and international law and granting the perpetrators exemption from punishment will only lead to new suicide attacks and wars, and the spiral of violence will continue. Europe must not continue to look away. Thus, the implementation of the Goldstone report, including in the United Nations General Assembly, must remain the job of the EU. ']"

For example, the fact that after 2006, thousands of rockets were fired against civilian populations in Israeli towns from the Gaza strip, and these were launched from densely populated areas and quite clearly from public buildings as well. We should ask further questions. How can a state defend its citizens in such a situation? Is it possible to fight with an army against terrorists who use civilians as human shields? If so, is it possible to avoid civilians becoming victims? What did the international community do to prevent this form of terrorism? Are there not intentionally varying standards in the area of adherence to human rights? Finding an answer to these serious questions is a challenging task for the common foreign policy of the EU.

Over 1 400 victims in the Gaza Strip are obviously too many. However, I am also certain that, without the rocket attacks on Israel, there would have been no military response. During a visit to the country by the Delegation to Israel, we discovered that Israel does not take military action lightly. The main accusation of the Goldstone report, that Israel deliberately and continually attacked civilians, does not hold water. The question of the extent to which Hamas used civilians as shields has not been adequately investigated. However, the report mentions that the Israeli army provided warnings by means of telephone calls and flyers. Hamas did nothing like this in connection with the rocket attacks on Israel.However, we also need to ask whether the UN itself did enough in Gaza, for example, to prevent the Hamas rockets being fired in the vicinity of UN facilities. I do not believe that the Goldstone report is a basis for further terrorist attacks on Israel – it does not justify that. It perhaps does not help any further, either.

This statement, this formal position of the High Representative, was also sent to the authorities in Belarus through official diplomatic channels.On Monday, we were able to discuss this matter in the Foreign Affairs Council, and we were able to have a thorough debate that I am sure will be repeated in future. There was, incidentally, a speech made by the Polish Minister, who expressed his concern and his feeling that there was a need to react and to take a position regarding the systematic harassment of members of the Polish minority. It must also be said that the different facets of the European Union are, without a shadow of a doubt, very concerned, and are monitoring this situation very directly and very closely.I think it is very important to convey to the authorities in Belarus that they must comply with the commitments that they have made in the OSCE to respect human rights and to protect minorities as an essential part of respecting human rights. In the Foreign Affairs Council that I referred to, there was an express request made to the European Ministers to draw the attention of the authorities in Belarus to this situation through the appropriate channels and in the appropriate forums.I think that it is in the common interest of Belarus, the European Union and all Europeans that we manage to have an influence in stopping these actions, which are contrary to human rights and to the rights of minorities, that are very considerable and significant in Belarus.

Situation of civil society and national minorities in Belarus (debate) ,"  Gunnar Hökmark  (PPE).   – Mr President, my thanks to the Spanish Presidency and to the Commission for their words on this situation.I think we need to be clear about one thing: what we are talking about now is not a single incident – it is the actions of a dictatorship and a brutal regime that is denying minority rights as well as the rights of its individual citizens. That is how things are in Belarus, and I think that must be the point of departure for our discussions on the dialogue with the regime.A dialogue must be mutual. When we show openness, we need to require the regime in Belarus to deliver, and they have not delivered the changes and the reforms that they should deliver. I would like to say and underline very much that this is not a Polish issue. Belarus is in the neighbourhood of the European Union. It is included in the Eastern Partnership. This is a European issue and, by its actions now, the regime in Belarus is distancing itself from open dialogue and cooperation with the European Union.We shall require, first of all, in a fundamental way, respect for minorities, respect for human rights, a stop to police brutality and a willingness to have a constructive dialogue with the European Union. I think this message must be made clear to the regime. Our dialogue must be a dialogue for democracy and human rights and, of course, we should turn to civil society because Belarus is much more than the regime. It is the people living in Belarus – the students, men and women, society.

We would like also to express our solidarity with all the citizens of Belarus who are not able to enjoy their basic civil and human rights. This is in a European country in the 21st century.

The main questions we have to pose now are, first, where we want to bring Belarus and, second, how we can do it. On the first question, I think we can all agree: we want to see Belarus democratic; we want to see Belarusian authorities democratically elected – parliament, president, governments, and local representatives; we want to see these authorities creating a free and creative atmosphere in Belarus; and, of course, we want to see the country moving closer to the EU.The second question is how we can achieve this. The European Union has changed its policy towards Belarus from isolation to engagement, and it seems that this policy is producing some results.

We need such a strategy in order to reinforce each other’s efforts, and we really need a political dialogue; we need a roadmap for Belarus which is very concrete, not just general recommendations but an action plan – a roadmap – which Belarus should adhere to.

We have seen that Mr Yanukovich has been elected in Ukraine. He is clearly a president who is looking more to Moscow than to Brussels. We must not allow his visit next week to pull the wool over our eyes.In my opinion, what is now happening in Belarus and the kind of actions that Mr Lukashenko has dared allow himself to take when it comes to the Polish minority in this country are signs that he also is looking more to Moscow than to the West. In so doing, he has evidently felt able to strip a minority of an EU Member State of its fundamental human rights. How is this possible? This is, of course, a consequence of Europe having turned its back too much on the East. We have not been open enough to the idea of genuine access to these countries.

A resolution of the European Parliament on Belarus adopted in March will be necessary, but it is even more necessary now. The persecution of Poles in Belarus is not only a matter for Poles, as those who have spoken before me have stressed, but is a symptom of an attitude to European standards, including standards concerning national minorities.Europe should draw Belarus out of the sphere of Russian influence, but should also require respect for those values which are the essence of the Union, such as civil liberties, freedom of the press, the rights of national and religious minorities and the right of association. If Lukashenko does not understand the language of European values, he will certainly understand the language of sanctions. However, not sanctions which hit at Belarusian society – we do not want sanctions like that – but sanctions which make life difficult for politicians and officials responsible for discrimination against Poles and the democratic opposition.There is an imbalance in relations between the EU and Belarus: the Union is opening the door for Minsk, but is receiving nothing, basically, in return. This one-way street leads nowhere. It is time for sanctions of a political nature, albeit temporary ones, even if in the form of the absence of representatives of the Belarusian Parliament from the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly and a return to the blacklist of officials of the Minsk regime who will not be admitted to European Union territory.

Theoretically, it would be possible to agree with such a course of action, if not for the fact that in these international standards, which Belarus itself accepted when it joined the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, human rights are not an internal matter.As happened recently in Iwieniec, a small town in central Belarus, when the authorities used, and I would say abused, the police force against a group of elderly people, pensioners, led by Teresa Sobol, who had, on her own initiative, raised considerable funds, mainly from abroad.

If even Mrs Georgieva, the Commissioner, who has five minutes available for her speech, uses only two minutes of that valuable time, it means that not only what you said, Mrs Georgieva, is not very satisfactory, but that you did not use the opportunity to speak out clearly on the subject. So I call on you, Mrs Georgieva, and also on the authorities of the European Union, to make use of the instruments which are at their disposal to oppose violations of human rights. We are not talking only about violations of the rights of citizens of Polish origin; we are talking about violations of human rights. ']"

Imprisonment of political opponents and intimidation of minority representatives are well-known practices used by authoritarian regimes. As a citizen of Slovakia and a representative of a minority, I understand the situation of the Polish minority as well as the plight of Mrs Borys in Belarus. The treatment of minorities as enemies and hostages of a neighbouring country is a regressive political manoeuvre usually seized upon by a political leadership when facing difficulties. Harassment of national minorities is part of the political practice in undemocratic regimes. Minority rights are an integral part of universal human rights, however, as confirmed by the Framework Convention of the Council of Europe. Violation of minority rights, harassment, intimidation and discrimination against persons belonging to minorities cannot, therefore, be considered a country’s internal matter. For that reason, the threatening, blackmailing message of the Belarus Government, conveyed to MEPs by the ambassador of Belarus, is completely unacceptable. Mr President, there is only one message the European Parliament can send to the government of Belarus, namely, that its repression of the democratic opposition and policy of threats against a minority are simply unacceptable.

They therefore affect the European Union, not only because they concern a minority that has a national reference point in a European Union country, but also because what we are talking about is a serious violation of the human rights of minorities, and therefore our attitude would be exactly the same whether it was a Polish minority or another minority.We are talking about a violation of human rights, which we have said are universal rights, and so this is not an issue that strictly requires a reaction from the European Union simply because in this case it concerns a Polish minority.

It started around mid-2009, and this led the EU Council of Ministers in November 2009 to request that the Commission formulate a proposal for the so-called ‘joint interim plan’ in support of reforms to be implemented with Belarus. The Commission’s services have prepared a draft of this joint interim plan for reforms. It is now with the High Representative, and the High Representative certainly would gladly take into account the recommendations coming out of the fact-finding mission that Parliament is starting tomorrow.My third point is that it would be with this last event in mind when the High Representative turns back to the services with feedback on this joint interim plan, that it would be finalised.Let me make my fourth and last point. In the second half of the 1980s, perestroika started in the former Soviet Union, and it led to, for the first time in the lives of many – mine included – an opportunity to compete for student and professional exchanges. In my case, it led me to the London School of Economics. It dramatically changed my professional life. It certainly made me much more helpful, more useful, to my own country.It is with this strong belief that it is by opening up the democratic channels for countries under oppressive regimes that we as Europeans can help these countries that I made – and again would repeat – my point on the importance and usefulness of people-to-people contacts, the usefulness of support for businesses, the usefulness – despite the great difficulties, the very unfortunate disrespect for minorities, which we condemn – of remaining engaged in a way that would lift up the chances of the Belarusian people to take the road to a free world and to be connected with the Union, and I would repeat the call for us to remain engaged in that way.

The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality has adopted a resolution that represents Parliament’s position as regards the Beijing platform. I would like to thank our colleagues on the committee very much for their good cooperation.The platform adopted in 1995 within the framework of the United Nations was an historically important step. The Platform for Action adopted was the first global document of its type. It took an overall view of women’s conditions and rights. The UN has a long and proud tradition in the area of human rights and adopted a declaration as far back as 1948.The Universal Declaration comprises 30 articles and they are often cited. This Declaration already stated – in Article 2 – that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms without distinction of any kind, and sex is expressly mentioned. Within the EU, the issue of equality between women and men has a clear basis both in the treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.The committee was united on the importance of the Beijing platform and the need to work more specifically within the EU on systematically monitoring developments and ensuring that we move towards increased equality in every area. The new European Institute for Gender Equality, based in Vilnius, will be a way for us to obtain assistance with this work and will also be able to provide research to show which political measures are most effective, for there are many areas in which we do not have the necessary facts or knowledge.I support the proposal for a European Protection Order, which I am very pleased that the Spanish Presidency has tabled. The Beijing platform contains a number of areas that are incredibly important if we are to make progress. These are areas such as poverty which, first and foremost, affects women, inadequate access to health care for women, violence against women in all its forms, and inequality in economic structures and in economic policy.As you are aware, a delegation of eight MEPs is to travel to New York to represent the European Parliament. We will follow the discussions and negotiations that form part of the assessment of how far the world has come in 15 years towards achieving the objectives of the platform. We will take the resolution that we are adopting tomorrow with us to New York, and it is important for us to have it with us.The Committee adopted one paragraph stating that sexual and reproductive health and sexual and reproductive rights are part of women’s rights and that these need to be improved in Europe and globally. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has requested a separate vote on this paragraph. We all know that when people want to vote separately on a paragraph, it is because it is particularly important, and that is why they do not want it voted on in a block with the rest of the resolution.I entirely agree with the PPE Group that paragraph 9 is central. However, I fear that they want to vote down this paragraph, which I feel would be deeply regrettable. I am fully aware that the Members of this Parliament have differing views and values, and that is only right. That is why we debate and discuss. This wording is a minimum, however, and should be able to be supported by everyone. No other wording has been proposed to replace paragraph 9.

182, 19. Beijing +15 - UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality (debate) ,"  Diego López Garrido,  President-in-Office of the Council. – (ES) Mrs Svensson, thank you very much for your question, because you know that one of the key, central and priority issues for the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union is gender equality. The Presidency has a series of objectives expressing this idea of equality in terms of the importance of the non-discrimination directive, and also in relation to something that you mentioned, which is combating gender violence and the importance of having an order to protect the victims of gender violence.In this respect, I am very happy to see Commissioner Reding here, who is responsible for implementing everything relating to equality between men and women from a judicial point of view. I would also like to start by apologising that the Spanish Minister for Equality is not here, as she has just attended a vote in the Spanish Senate on the reform of the abortion law, which, incidentally, had a good outcome, as it has just been adopted this afternoon in the Spanish Parliament.The Council of the European Union has always approved and has always been behind the Union and the United Nations in the area of gender equality. The Swedish Presidency produced the Beijing +15 report, which the Spanish Presidency is going to present to the 54th session of the Commission on the Status of Women, and it must be said that although a great deal of progress has been made in this area, there is still a lot to be done.In this respect, the Presidency has highlighted, for example, the need to improve the data and to make better use of the indicators that we created at the Beijing Platform. As you know, there are 12 indicators produced within the European Union for monitoring, assessing and evaluating actual gender equality, although in some cases, we have still not succeeded in designing them, for example, in the areas of human rights, the media and the environment.I would like to say that the Spanish Presidency is going to hold a technical meeting in May to discuss women, the media and stereotypes, as a subject relating to the media, which is also something that falls under the remit of Commissioner Reding.I would like to conclude by saying that there is a very important issue at the moment, as everyone knows, which is the economic crisis. As well as the damage that is being done, it could also be an obstacle to the progress of equality between men and women. It is, however, also true that paradoxically, gender equality could help us to overcome and combat the crisis: through gender equality and equal access to jobs for men and women.I am talking very specifically about the Europe 2020 strategy. The European Union institutions have made it clear that they want the Europe 2020 strategy to have a gender equality dimension right across the strategy, so that the issue of equality between men and women is also part of the strategy.In its report last year, the European Parliament asked the Council and the Commission to include a chapter on integrating the gender dimension in the 2020 strategy. The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 30 November last year, the informal EPSCO Council, the one that has just taken place in Barcelona, also said that the Member States and the Commission must work to ensure that, in accordance with their competence, the gender dimension can be consolidated in the 2020 strategy, and that all the relevant political fields are taken into account. I am therefore sure that this, along with the Commission’s programme of work, a major programme of work that has always been a fundamental instrument for guiding this strategy, is going to mean that this aspect is included in the document which the Commission has promised us for 3 March on the 2020 strategy (which has been mentioned by President Van Rompuy and the President of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso).We need to keep on working, we need to keep driving gender equality policies forward. It is not only an issue of justice, but an issue of consistency with the spirit of the European Union, so that it can continue to be a reference point in the world for equality between men and women.

183, 19. Beijing +15 - UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality (debate) ,"  Viviane Reding,  Vice-President of the Commission. – (FR) Mr President, for me it is an honour that my first speech during Question Time in Parliament is an answer to questions concerning women. Indeed, as Commissioner for Fundamental Rights, I think that the subject of fundamental rights linked to equal treatment between men and women is one of the most important and also one of the oldest. Furthermore, I recall with great emotion how, more than 15 years ago, as a young Luxembourg MEP, I prepared the Beijing Platform for Action in Luxembourg; now, here we are in the European Parliament to prepare the follow-up to the Beijing Platform for Action. We have come full circle.I do not need to underline that; as you know, equality between men and women is one of the fundamental values of the European Union, and you can count on the unfailing commitment of the Commission in this area.In the course of this year, I will present a new Commission strategy for gender equality, which will be a follow-up to the existing Roadmap for equality 2006-2010. In a few days’ time, when the work of the 54th Commission on the Status of Women begins at the United Nations, marking the 15th anniversary of Beijing, the European Parliament will send a very important delegation. I myself will be present there, along with the President of the Council, and this will be a first. We will both take the floor during the plenary session. I think that this, too, is a very strong symbol.It will also be an opportunity to gauge, at international level, the progress made in the 12 areas for action which were identified in Beijing, but also to see what inequalities persist, because even though there have been successes, there are still challenges to meet. Furthermore, I must say that the European Union is and will remain an important supporter of the work of the United Nations, concerning both the ongoing reform of the institutional mechanisms and the creation of this gender entity within the United Nations.The European Union also represents an influential supporter in development terms, in particular, in the context of the Millennium Development Goals, which ensure an important place for 50% of the citizens who contribute to this development globally. Indeed, we know very well that without the contribution of women, there will be no development. That is why equal treatment between men and women is a horizontal policy in the Commission, conducted not just by the Commissioner responsible for this area, but also by other Commissioners in their own areas of responsibility, namely the areas concerning policies within the European Union as well as its external policies and, in particular, its cooperation and development policies.We all know that the creation of the Beijing Platform for Action represented a major step forward. Following the adoption of this platform, gender mainstreaming became widespread throughout the European Union. That was the signal sent out in Beijing. The impact has been truly remarkable given that, in all our Member States, our equality policies are no longer confined to targeted actions, but are, from now on, integrated into all relevant policies.The Beijing Platform for Action has also enabled us to follow progress made in relation to equality on the basis of indicators developed by Council for most of the areas of action. There are 12 actions and nine indicators. We are very proud of the results, but there are still three indicators to establish, which I think the Council is committed to doing by adopting conclusions to forge ahead and develop these outstanding indicators.The 15th anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action. The Swedish Presidency has taken stock of what has been done in the EU with regard to equality.

It is only natural that in this system, which is going to get Europe moving again, women will play a special role, especially at a time when fewer and fewer people are in employment. In fact, we no longer even have a choice: we need women for economic development. It is no longer even just a question of gender equality; it is a question of economic policy, and that alone. We therefore have no other choice in the matter. We need women if we want Europe to overcome its difficulties, and these new indicators will, of course, help us in this way. Within the high level group, we have developed a work programme that will enable us to monitor existing indicators and create indicators that still need to be implemented. Naturally, we will be assisted in this task by the European Institute for Gender Equality, which, from next week – and this is another symbol, which comes at exactly the same time as the meeting is being held in New York – will be established permanently in Vilnius.Mr President, on my return from New York, I will visit you to discuss the Commission’s strategy on equality.

In so doing, we will certainly subject our current position with regard to what we have achieved and what we still want to achieve to close critical examination. The call for equality, development and peace at the World Conference on Women that took place on 15 June 1995 in Beijing is still a concrete statement of our goals today, including in Europe.We are on our way, with the goal firmly in view. However, we have to admit that the road is not an easy one, that there are traffic jams, blockages and sometimes even one-way streets along the way. We constantly need to redefine the route, always keeping the destination firmly in sight. There is an old German saying: many roads lead to Rome. During the search for the right common path, I therefore invite us all to find more common ground.Gender equality policy cannot and must not be a subject for voting on and for narrow, enforced majorities. My group grants the freedom to decide on this matter, and therefore, Mrs Svensson, we would like a split vote. Equality needs to become a way of thinking. This requires sensitivity and it requires the power of persuasion. In her resolution, Mrs Svensson has touched many open wounds. There are still many unfinished matters that need to be addressed and they have been mentioned: no stereotypical thinking, equal pay for equal work, poverty among women, violence against women and the ageing society, which affects women in particular. For us, these are the absolutely key issues in this resolution that we want to address.Mere declarations of intent are of little help. The list of the many resolutions, strategies and pacts alone takes up two pages of Mrs Svensson’s report.

This is a moment of reflection where we need not only to evaluate what we have achieved so far but also to think about new ways of attaining the goals set out in 1995.The beginning was reassuring: in 1995, a global consensus was reached according to which women and men were equal from all points of view, including political, economic, legal and social. However, despite this consensus, the sequel is less stirring. Many of the goals of the Beijing Platform for Action are still far from being reached. In many countries, women are still not sufficiently empowered and poverty has a feminine face.Moreover, even in the 21st century, even in developed countries, we notice again debate on some basic issues, questioning already-established rights such as sexual and reproductive health rights. I am very happy that the European Parliament is not following such trends but, on the contrary, committing itself to these basic rights. Nevertheless, the political debates, the conservative attacks on human rights are alarming and they clearly underline the fact that the fight for women’s rights is far from over.I do not think that human rights can be subject to compromise.

Poverty is the greatest single determinant of health. The feminisation of poverty has a real impact on the physical and mental health of women.Minority women are experiencing poverty, exclusion and discrimination. Their needs are largely unknown and ignored and their voices are not heard. For Roma women, life expectancy can be up to 10 years less than those of the majority. Infant mortality is three to four times greater than the majority population.Discrimination, exclusion and poverty also need to be considered in the light of the ageing population.

Beijing +15 - UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality (debate) ,"  Edit Bauer  (PPE).   – (HU) 15 years after the adoption of the Beijing Platform we could and should obviously talk about a lot of things. Yet I would rather talk about that which is our task. We have one tool in our hands, and that is lawmaking. Many things have happened during these 15 years, in Member States as well as at EU level; great steps have been taken, mainly as a result of the adoption of anti-discriminatory laws. This represented a significant step forward towards bringing about equal opportunities. Admittedly, we cannot be satisfied with Community legislation, or often even with that of Member States, as we often see proof of how ineffective these regulations remain. Often the situation changes very little after the laws come into force. As an example, we can cite the wage gap between women and men. For more than 30 years, the law has prohibited gender discrimination, yet these differences have scarcely changed in the last 10 years, occasionally even showing an upward trend.Access to these rights is a particular problem, since legal redress is often extremely expensive and complicated. Authorities responsible for enforcing equal treatment, charged with the oversight of anti-discrimination legislation in Member States, are generally poorly equipped and, due to a lack of resources, their competence is often limited to the provision of information and advice. Hopefully, this year we will also get a chance to look into the effectiveness of the laws we formulate and adopt here. It is evident that not everything can be solved by legislative means. Stereotypes are difficult to change, yet we have to recognise that the effectiveness of our laws stand or fall on whether we succeed in doing so. One sentence by way of conclusion: from time to time, it is certainly worth looking back at the road we have covered, but we also have to see clearly where we are headed. We pin great hopes on the reformulated 2020 strategy as well as on the reformulation of the equal opportunity strategy.

For these reasons, we do not merely support the resolution which was approved in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, but also hope that it will be approved by a majority of this Parliament, including the paragraph which emphasises that sexual and reproductive health and rights are an integral part of the women’s rights agenda, and that it is essential to step up efforts to improve women’s reproductive rights and health, both in Europe and globally.', 'It is time to put an end to inequality and stereotypes and prioritise promoting equal rights for women and men in social progress.

Fifteen years on from this historic UN conference, the assessment of the efforts made to improve the situation of women in the world is disappointing. Numerous programmes adopted down the years have sadly remained far from a reality, not to mention the Millennium Development Goals, which include the promotion of gender equality. Unfortunately, domestic violence, the use of rape as a weapon of war, genital mutilation, forced marriage, human trafficking or sexual slavery remain the nightmare which destroys the lives of millions of women throughout the whole world.I believe that we cannot talk in terms of success unless the European Union becomes even more heavily involved in this area. We need a comprehensive strategy aimed at tackling poverty, lack of education and information, impunity, armed conflicts and human trafficking for the purposes of prostitution. I think that it is important for us not to forget that, before it becomes a cause of evil, violence against women is an effect triggered by a whole set of factors which we must take more united and firm action to eradicate.

That is a good thing. Women should not be given a worse deal than men without good and sound reasons.However, I do not think that quotas of women – so-called ‘positive’ discrimination – is a sensible approach to this. Skills must be the key criterion, not gender. I therefore strongly reject the quota of women in the appointment of the European Commission. Instead of concerning ourselves with quotas, we ought really to be focusing on women who are oppressed and discriminated against.In Europe, we allow Muslim women to continue to live in a kind of parallel society, where violence against women and other forms of oppression are part of everyday life. We allow Muslim women in Europe to have no freedom to make decisions over many areas of their lives. It starts with the mode of dress, continues through education to their choice of career, as well as to their choice of husband. Women’s rights campaigners from Islamic countries approach us, hoping that something will be done about it here. Where is the Europe of human rights when we need it?I therefore believe that we should stop these artificial discussions about quotas and instead work to combat the massive discrimination that occurs daily in Europe under the guise of the freedom of religion – this truly has no place in our enlightened community of values.

208, 19.

Nevertheless, and you are right in this, we have good laws but practice does not follow. I believe that the first thing we will have to do is not to create new laws, but see that the laws are de facto applied in society.I dream of a time when we can have a debate in this House and 50% of the speakers are men and 50% are women. I have a dream where we no longer need International Women’s Day because there is no longer any problem. It is nice to dream, practice is there, and we have to take things in hand. That is why I am very grateful to the Spanish Presidency which has put the woman question at the top of the priority list.I am very dedicated, together with my colleagues in the Commission, to have gender mainstreaming included in all the policies which we are going to present. Together with my colleague Mr Andor, who is responsible for employment, we will see that this is put into practice in the 2020 programme.For the other elements I will, as I have already said, work together with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality on the new strategy for equality where questions such as the gender pay gap and women in decision making will be high on the agenda because they are real structural problems which we need to solve. But there are also questions of society which go very deep and which we have to tackle with the help of women’s organisations, with the help of the Ministers in the Member States, with the help of national laws, with the help of European laws, and there is, of course, the terrible question of violence against women. I believe that this is going to be at the forefront of the work which we are going to lead.I think nevertheless, ladies, that when your strong delegation goes to New York to celebrate 15 years of the Beijing Platform, we should be proud, because if we look at what we have achieved in the last 15 years, it is a great deal. All right, we have not yet arrived at where our dreams will lead us, but we have achieved much and, through this experience, we can very much help women on other continents. That will be the subject of the New York meeting. It will not only look at what European women are doing, but also at what European women, European policies, the development policies can do for women in other continents.I also believe in this sense that the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is a beautiful text which should be read by every child in the European schools and which should be worked on by every student in our universities, really makes the right point: there is no difference between men and women. They are equal and it is our responsibility to see that we speak up when this fundamental question is not put into practice in our application of laws in the Member States.

213, 19. Beijing +15 - UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality (debate) ,"  Joanna Senyszyn  (S&D),  in writing. – (PL) One of the strategic areas defined in the Beijing Platform for Action is that of the rights of women as an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. The objective is to fully introduce international instruments for the protection of these rights, including the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. One form of discrimination is violation of the reproductive rights of women. A report on respect for reproductive rights in Poland in 2007 and the recommendations of the UN Human Rights Committee which are based on this report show clearly that Polish women have difficulties in gaining access to reimbursable contraception, medical care during pregnancy, prenatal tests and even to pain-free labour. They are denied the possibility of a legal abortion in practically every case, even in cases which are permissible under law. As a result, 200-400 legal terminations of pregnancy are performed in Poland every year, compared to 100 000 illegal ones.I propose adoption of a legal abortion rate, calculated as the number of legal terminations of pregnancy per 1 000 live births per year, as a measure of the equality of women in Member States of the EU. In countries where women have the right to choose abortion, this rate fluctuates at around 200. In Poland, it is 1. This is an objective measure of the violation of women’s reproductive rights in Poland. I appeal for more effective cooperation between the EU and the UN over monitoring of women’s rights and the introduction of measurements which quantify violations of women’s rights.

As a result, 200-400 legal terminations of pregnancy are performed in Poland every year, compared to 100 000 illegal ones.', 'I propose adoption of a legal abortion rate, calculated as the number of legal terminations of pregnancy per 1 000 live births per year, as a measure of the equality of women in Member States of the EU. In countries where women have the right to choose abortion, this rate fluctuates at around 200. In Poland, it is 1. This is an objective measure of the violation of women’s reproductive rights in Poland. I appeal for more effective cooperation between the EU and the UN over monitoring of women’s rights and the introduction of measurements which quantify violations of women’s rights. ']"
214, 19. Beijing +15 - UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality (debate) ,"  Anna Záborská  (PPE),  in writing. – (FR) The resolution does not reflect the whole Beijing Platform for Action. As ever, it is easier to dwell on sexual stereotypes, ‘reproductive health’, not to mention abortion, CEDAW, violence and quotas. Are there no other problems for the vast majority of women and mothers in Europe and throughout the world? Is it not time to tackle other obstacles as well? Point 9 of the Beijing Platform for Action, however, declares as its goal the empowerment of all women. It is essential that all women can identify with public equal opportunities policies, which respect their natural difference and their necessary complementary nature, and do not lose sight of the importance of national and regional identities or historical, cultural and religious diversity. The implementation of the Platform for Action falls under the sovereign responsibility of each Member State, taking into account and showing strict respect for diverse religious and ethical values, and for the cultural heritage and philosophical convictions of individuals and their communities. Had the implementation of the Beijing Platform respected these premises, we would not have observed just a slight improvement in the situation of women.

In many countries, there are no solutions at all in this area, or those which are in place are not sufficient to ensure women a decent living.

One-minute speeches on matters of political importance,"  Georgios Papanikolaou  (PPE).   – (EL) Mr President, the problem of illegal immigration in Greece is far worse than in the rest of the European Union, as we all know. There are various reasons for this, ranging from its geographical location to its long coastal border.Under these circumstances, the initiative by the Greek Government, which is facilitating the acquisition of Greek nationality by immigrants in an unprecedented manner, is – at best – an improvisation in times such as these and has given rise to the following paradox: the proposal by the government of the country with the most acute problem contains the most lenient regulations, at every level, in the entire European Union.This is encouraging rather than discouraging illegal immigration, to the detriment of legal immigration. It is undermining social cohesion and taking a fragmented approach to the issue, by only examining the last link in a chain which includes illegal entry, asylum, deportation and leave to remain and work in the European Union. It is opening the window to the acquisition of European nationality to an indeterminate number of illegal immigrants.From this perspective, it is a European question which we should address intensively in the immediate future.

Canada justified its move on the grounds that, on the other side of the ocean, Czech citizens, particularly Roma, were applying en masse for asylum. In these circumstances I would like to say that in the Czech Republic, the same conditions apply to everyone, regardless of whether they have Czech, Slovak, Vietnamese or Ukrainian nationality or whether they are of Czech, Afro-American or Roma origin. The Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms, which is part of our constitutional law, declares equal national and ethnic rights for all citizens. The fact that Canada explains its actions with reference to the Roma is, in itself, discriminatory, because it is an admission that visa conditions are being changed because of one ethnic group. Instead of costly and administratively-demanding visas, Canada should, if anything, think hard about these conditions.

One-minute speeches on matters of political importance,"  Luís Paulo Alves  (S&D).   – (PT) I would like to point out that, in island regions, air transport is sometimes the only means of access and that operating conditions depend on the volume of passengers and cargo carried. While there are some island regions where these volumes are large enough to attract many air transport operators – bringing competition and low transport prices, and thus improving accessibility – there are other areas, such as the Azores, where these volumes are much lower, and this makes them unattractive to operators. As a result, air fares are higher, hindering the mobility of people and limiting the area’s attractiveness to tourists, which would allow their enormous potential for development and for diversifying their economic base to flourish and become stronger. This constraint is particularly harsh in times of crisis such as the period we are experiencing at present.This means that temporary assistance is crucial for promoting an increase in passenger and cargo volumes so that the market can begin to function. This would also allow these regions, which have a high potential for tourism, to be included in the objectives of the trans-European networks, which aim at expanding towards the edges of Europe.

Monthly data on the level of unemployment in the Union is increasingly depressing. There are currently over 23 million people in Europe who are without work. This means the crisis has ruined the efforts which have been made over many years to promote employment. An exceptionally detrimental phenomenon is the continually rising number of unemployed young people. Currently, one in five young Europeans is now without work. It should be assumed that this situation will lead to exceptionally harmful social consequences, such as a rise in crime, alcoholism, drug abuse and problem families. As for possible ways to get out of the recession quickly, I think we should make good use of our greatest asset – the Community’s internal market. Greater coordination is needed at European level to make full use of the possibilities of the common economic space. We need further simplification of the rules for its operation, and we need to develop true economic union.

The Eastern Partnership programme has offered opportunities for the regime in Belarus to relax its rigid control of society and open the way for democratic reforms. However, this process needs to be reciprocal. The EU’s economic assistance and opening of the cooperation projects can result in reliable progress only if each goodwill step by the EU is accompanied by genuine measures toward the re-establishment of an open democratic society in Belarus. The assessment of the situation by Sakharov prize winner Milinkevich is pessimistic. As he told us, the human rights situation has not improved. In fact, it has worsened. At the same time, bearing in mind that the Lukashenko regime depends more than ever on Western technology, money and markets, the EU has an efficient leverage over the regime’s further behaviour. But first we need to understand that the Belarus dictator is probing to see how serious his EU partners really are about the importance of democratic reforms. Therefore, it is so crucial to send a clear message that the EU’s priority is real changes in the human rights situation.

259, 21. Major natural disaster in the autonomous region of Madeira (debate) ,"  Günther Oettinger,  Member of the Commission. – (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission is concerned and saddened by the terrible events in Madeira, especially by the high number of victims. I would like to extend my sympathy to all of the inhabitants of Madeira affected by the disaster. The Commission extends its condolences to the families of the victims, in particular.Yesterday, my colleague, Johannes Hahn, as the competent Member of the Commission, was able to talk to the President of the Autonomous Region of Madeira, Mr Jardim, who said that the situation remains serious. However, the regional and national emergency services have it under control. It does not currently require support from the European Civil Protection Mechanism.That said, the damage is so severe that Madeira is hoping for financial aid from the EU Solidarity Fund. The Commission is currently examining all possible means for providing EU financial aid to Madeira. Back in 2003, following the horrific fire disaster, we were able to grant solidarity aid amounting to more than EUR 48 million to Portugal. The Solidarity Fund was created in 2002 to be able to provide financial assistance at EU level to Member States affected by serious natural disasters.However, the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund is subject to certain criteria being met. The most important prerequisite is the submission of an application for assistance by the Portuguese Government. May I remind you that the Regulation establishing the Solidarity Fund normally only permits mobilisation of the fund for large-scale disasters where the cost of the damage exceeds a threshold of 0.6% of the gross national income of the State affected. For Portugal, this currently means that the cost of the damage must exceed EUR 958 million. However, in exceptional circumstances, and if particular criteria are met, assistance may also be granted for smaller, ‘regional’ disasters, particularly if one of the outermost regions, like Madeira, is affected. As the Commission does not yet have sufficient information about the extent of the damage, it is still too early to say whether these conditions will be met.The authorities in Portugal should now carry out a swift and thorough assessment of the damage and submit an application to the Commission within ten weeks. My colleague Mr Hahn will meet with Portugal’s Interior Minister, Mr Pereira, this Friday to discuss where to go from here. On 6 and 7 March, Mr Hahn will visit Madeira in order to see the damage first hand. The European Commission’s Directorate-General for Regional Policy will be available to provide any support that may be required to help Portugal’s authorities to prepare the application.I would like to remind you that financial aid from our Solidarity Fund is not paid out straight away. The Fund is an instrument to help Member States deal with the financial consequences of disasters; it is not an urgent instrument. The resources for the Solidarity Fund are provided by means of an additional contribution from the Member States over and above the normal budget. It therefore requires the approval of the European Parliament, your approval in other words, and that of the Council, by means of an amendment. The whole process, from the time of the application until the aid is paid out, will take several months. However, we, the Commission, will make every effort to keep the process as short as possible.The Structural Funds are not available for immediate emergency measures. They may be able to provide some help in connection with the long-term reconstruction. The Commission will discuss the options and possible sensible and necessary programme amendments in the short term with the administrative authorities in Portugal.I would like to assure you that the Commission will do everything in its power to help the people and authorities of Madeira to cope with this terrible natural disaster.

Major natural disaster in the autonomous region of Madeira (debate) ,"  Nuno Teixeira,  on behalf of the PPE Group. – (PT) I take the floor in this Chamber today with my voice weighed down with the distress of someone who personally experienced and witnessed the tragedy that struck Madeira last Saturday. Obviously, I join in the feeling of pain and grief that has befallen the families of the 42 victims we now know have died, to whom I offer my condolences and respect for their loss.The true extent of this disaster has yet to be revealed, given that the search and rescue teams, who have been working without interruption since Saturday in a Herculean effort which I salute, are only now beginning to reach the most isolated populations. It is feared that the number of victims could increase.The scene is one of large-scale destruction, involving significant material damage to access routes, with roads and bridges totally destroyed, and to essential services such as water and electricity supplies. There are more than 600 displaced persons who have lost their homes and personal possessions. The economic and social impact of this catastrophe is preventing people from returning to a normal way of life. However, it is now necessary to look forwards. We also need to send a message of solidarity, hope and confidence to the people affected. Help needs to be given, and the European Union and Parliament, in particular, have a role to play here, as they are fundamental in the process of mobilising the Solidarity Fund. Whenever we are called upon to intervene, we have to do so promptly because we cannot ask the people affected to wait, especially when they need us most.I hereby appeal to the Commission and its President, Mr Barroso, and to Johannes Hahn, Commissioner for Regional Policy, in particular. I welcome his plan to visit Madeira shortly, and ask him to take this message of hope, assistance and support for reconstruction, because now is the time to rebuild what nature has unfortunately taken from us once again. I have complete faith that we will do so because, as the anthem of Madeira has taught me, ‘the people of Madeira are humble, stoical and brave. They are the people who ploughed the earth among the hard rocks; they are heroes of working in the mountain wilderness.

Torrential rain, strong winds and heavy seas rendered the centre of the tourist city of Funchal unrecognisable and left devastation and death in their wake. There has also been great damage to public and private infrastructure, as well as the natural environment and cultural heritage. Initial estimates, Commissioner, suggest that damage will exceed EUR 1 billion, so this will fall within the criteria for the Solidarity Fund. Unfortunately, there are also dozens of dead to mourn, a considerable number of injured and missing people and hundreds of homeless. The images of devastation and suffering have been shown all over the world and no one has remained indifferent. Expressions of solidarity have come from all four corners of the globe.The European Union and European Commission must also demonstrate their active solidarity with this outermost island region by urgently mobilising the Solidarity Fund, in order to reduce the high social and economic impacts and to help restore normality to the affected area.I conclude, Commissioner, by asking the following: this Parliament has already approved changes to the Solidarity Fund.

It is a tragedy which violently struck part of the European Union which, in solidarity, should provide assistance without reservation. It should unreservedly help the families of the victims who have died and the people who have suddenly been left with nothing, and it should assist in the reconstruction of the built environment, by restoring to the island of Madeira what nature has stripped away. This, Mr President, is certain: the message of the anthem of Madeira has been mentioned here, but I have also drawn a lesson from the anthem of Portugal, which proclaims, ‘heroes of the sea, noble people, brave nation’.

284, 22. Investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community (debate) ,"  Adina-Ioana Vălean,  rapporteur. – Madam President, I fully appreciate your presence in the plenary this evening. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for our fruitful discussions and our work on this report. The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is giving the European Union more competence in the field of energy policy. I believe this is an area where, if Member States work together, Europe can ensure secure, cheaper and more efficient energy for its citizens. Together, we can minimise the impact of unpredictable events, such as the gas disruption Europe experienced last winter.Of course, Europe cannot interfere in gas flow outside its borders or solve such disputes, but what we can do is ensure that our infrastructure is able to cope with supply shortages or failures, and make the market more transparent and efficient. Europe has set this priority very high on its agenda. Last year, we adopted a third energy package which aims to ensure a more competitive and efficient energy market. A regulation on the security of gas supplies is currently on the table in Parliament and tomorrow’s vote on the regulation on notification of investments in energy infrastructure will contribute to making the market more transparent and more predictable.In this context, I think it would be a pity to waste the opportunity this new instrument offers, by not applying the correct legal basis provided by the new Article 194 of the Lisbon Treaty. It is a very important institutional, political and legal point. This regulation is not only a tool for collecting information; it can also give an overall picture of investments in energy infrastructure as a basis for policy making. So, in the event that the Council adopts this regulation on the wrong legal basis, I consider that Parliament should pursue this matter further at the European Court of Justice, and let me assure you, it will.On the substance now; I have said this before to Mr Barroso and I will say it again to you, Commissioner Oettinger: Europe is standing at a turning point and our priority now should be more than ever to support our companies and create a positive environment for competitiveness. We therefore need strong policies and especially a stronger reliable energy policy. The aim in the end is to ensure secure and cheap energy for both our citizens and our companies. In this perceptive, I should hope that gathering data will not become a purpose in itself. We have to make sure that this regulation will not create yet another bureaucratic burden on companies and that confidentiality of commercially sensitive information will be reinforced.On another issue, I can only regret that the PPE and S&D Groups introduced an amendment requiring EU companies to provide data on investments in projects in third countries. I challenge anyone to find the legal basis in the treaties that would allow extra-territoriality in energy policy. Furthermore, I believe we should first start proving that we know what is planned at European level before looking outside our borders. I have also noticed the temptation in this House to include everything in this regulation. I think that this is a mistake. For this instrument to be efficient, we must focus on real consistent information and keep in mind avoiding too much bureaucracy and confidentiality issues for our companies and the Commission. I have tried to achieve this balance by, on the one hand, giving the Commission the opportunity of having an overview of possible future developments but also, on the other hand, ensuring that this picture is as accurate as possible.We also need some certainty about future investments to ensure proper and solid policy making. I would also need to be reassured, Commissioner Oettinger. I want to avoid a situation where the Commission, having gathered the data, starts imposing investment plans and ends up telling companies not to invest here but there.

I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for our fruitful discussions and our work on this report. The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is giving the European Union more competence in the field of energy policy. I believe this is an area where, if Member States work together, Europe can ensure secure, cheaper and more efficient energy for its citizens. Together, we can minimise the impact of unpredictable events, such as the gas disruption Europe experienced last winter.', 'Of course, Europe cannot interfere in gas flow outside its borders or solve such disputes, but what we can do is ensure that our infrastructure is able to cope with supply shortages or failures, and make the market more transparent and efficient. Europe has set this priority very high on its agenda. Last year, we adopted a third energy package which aims to ensure a more competitive and efficient energy market. A regulation on the security of gas supplies is currently on the table in Parliament and tomorrow’s vote on the regulation on notification of investments in energy infrastructure will contribute to making the market more transparent and more predictable.', 'In this context, I think it would be a pity to waste the opportunity this new instrument offers, by not applying the correct legal basis provided by the new Article 194 of the Lisbon Treaty. It is a very important institutional, political and legal point. This regulation is not only a tool for collecting information; it can also give an overall picture of investments in energy infrastructure as a basis for policy making.

It is therefore important for the Commission to get an overview of what new investment projects are planned or are under construction and which old installations are to be permanently taken out of service. Thus, our proposal is to develop and rework an information instrument that originated at the time of another crisis, namely, the first oil price crisis.This proposal aims to extend the area of application of the regulation, in particular, in the areas of renewable energies and CCS. We welcome the proposals that have come from within Parliament to include areas of application such as district heating networks or gas, coal and oil production capacities.

287, 22. Investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community (debate) ,"  Günther Oettinger,  Member of the Commission. – (DE) Madam President, honourable Members, I raised the issue of how the Commission wants to evaluate the information that it obtains from the Member States in the context of this regulation. Our analyses will firstly look at the anticipated development of the infrastructure in terms of the expected changes in demand. We will consider whether the new capacities that are expected will match the forecasts of future demand or whether we can expect shortfalls.In this regard, unlike in the current regulation, it would seem important for institutional talks on these subject areas to be introduced. The Commission therefore proposes, firstly, to publish a report every two years on structural developments in energy infrastructure. This is intended to help to improve transparency for all market operators. Secondly, we also want a political debate with Parliament and the Member States in order to draw conclusions from this. I would like to emphasise that last point, because one thing is clear: the regulation itself is an instrument for collecting and gathering information in order to show us if any action needs to be taken. How we go about this needs to be dealt with in the context of specific energy policy initiatives.This brings me to the point, Mrs Vălean, that is of interest to you and to the entire House, namely the new Article 194 of the Treaty of Lisbon and its application. For all of us – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – this article represents both an opportunity and an obligation to shape EU energy policy in close cooperation – in other words, together with the European Parliament in particular. As the new Commissioner for Energy, I would therefore like to involve this House extensively in all future policy measures as far as possible and at an early stage. However, the legal act to which today’s debate refers only concerns the collection and evaluation of information in the energy sector and therefore is based, according to the Commission’s interpretation, on Articles 337 and 187 of the Euratom Treaty. The content of the regulation complies with both of these articles of primary law and, in accordance with case law, the choice of legal basis for secondary law must be linked to measurable criteria relating to content.No energy policy is established by the collection and evaluation of information alone, which is why, in my view, a decision is needed here.

Optimal solutions for investment in this area require objective information about the condition of the infrastructure in individual national systems, as well as information which is essential to carry out a central EU study of future integration.What is important is that the element of competition in the common market for products and services, which is influenced mainly by the cost of energy in each Member State, and the need to maintain trade secrets, should not obscure or disrupt integration processes. Let us keep secret only what must be kept secret – military infrastructure facilities.This is important, mainly because decisions taken about investments such as this, for example, the construction of a northern or southern gas pipeline, should not be exclusively egoistic measures taken in the interests of just a few EU Member States.

Energy efficiency is crucial for both jobs and growth in Europe and is essential if we are to achieve the 2 °C objective. The two main prerequisites in this context are smart energy grids and a free, well-functioning internal market in energy. Naturally, both these require the Commission to have a good knowledge of the current infrastructure and market – and that is what this proposal is about.We also need the bureaucracy that deals with this information to be efficient, however. We must avoid duplication and the information communicated must be that which is required to achieve the objectives set. If we are to achieve a functioning market, it is also incredibly important that the information gathered from European enterprises is protected, so as to avoid any disturbance of the market. I will be supporting the author’s report and I call on the House to reject the incredibly bureaucratic proposals tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.As mentioned previously, the proposal’s objectives are incredibly important – so important that they have been given a separate legal basis in Article 194 of the Treaty of Lisbon, in which they are practically listed word for word.

We continue to talk about the importance of reducing CO2 emissions, even while the theory of man-made global warming is falling apart in front of our eyes.But if we were serious about reducing CO2 emissions, surely we should be favouring nuclear power stations and not renewables. We have chosen to put in place incentives that grossly distort the market in favour of renewables and against nuclear power.Europe needs competitive, reliable, mainstream, base-load, generating capacity which nuclear power can deliver. In the meantime, the pathetic trickle of intermittent electricity from wind farms cannot be relied upon to power Europe’s industries.Many countries in the EU, including my own, are facing the prospect of an energy crunch later this decade, partly as a result of the Large Combustion Plant Directive.

However, in order for words and declarations to be followed by specific solutions and measurable effects, we should first and foremost ensure an appropriate level of financing for investments which are being planned. According to a report produced by Exxon Mobil, one of the world’s largest fuel corporations, world demand for energy is going to rise by around 1.2% annually, so that by the year 2030, demand will have risen by approximately 35%.The requirement for gas, which will be the second most important energy source, is going to rise by 1.8% annually. Currently, the world uses a little over 3 billion m3. In 2030, it will need around 4.3 billion m3. A consequence of Europe’s growing need for gas will be an increased dependence on imports of this resource, from 45% in 2005 to 70% in 2030. In view of these figures, financial support from the European Community for the energy network should be treated strategically.In the present economic and financial situation, it is especially difficult to find investors for many projects.

The new policy requirements such as targets for the fuel mix will alter Member States’ policies so that they will benefit from a new, modernised energy infrastructure.The proposal from the Commission is to revise the current system of notification on energy investment projects. The aim is to gather suitable information on planned investments in order to enable the Commission to monitor the situation regarding the infrastructure and anticipate potential problems. Given that current EU legislation already imposes reporting and notification obligations in relation to investments and infrastructures, the use of this information must be better coordinated so that duplication of obligations such as reporting and confidentiality can be avoided, while also improving citizens’ access to information.

Amending Budget 1/2010 (Section I, European Parliament) (debate) ","  Vladimír Maňka,  rapporteur. – (SK) We all know full well that it is only through joint efforts at the European level that we will manage to meet the greatest challenges of the 21st century, which are climate change, the risks and cost of raw materials and energy, economic globalisation and threats to our security.If Europe is to confront these problems, it must have effective and complex instruments at its disposal. The Lisbon Treaty will provide such instruments.In December, we approved the budget of the European institutions for 2010. For reasons connected with the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty, our work on the budget was not completed in December and it will continue into April. Today we are in the initial stage of the treaty coming into effect, and the EU will need to have adequate funding at its disposal from the outset in order to implement the new policies. The Lisbon Treaty has an impact on the entire range of services of the European Parliament and other institutions. As far as the European Parliament is concerned, codecision making will increase dramatically, covering up to 95% of legislation. Areas such as freedom, security and justice, agriculture, fisheries, research and structural funds have been added. There will be greater use of qualified majority voting in the Council and the creation of a number of new legal foundations in areas such as tourism, sport, energy, civil defence, administration and cooperation. This will all increase the legislative activities of the EU generally, with a significant overall impact on the powers of the European Parliament and its activities, and therefore also on the need to strengthen the administration.The main priority of the amending budget proposed by the Presidency of the European Parliament in connection with the Lisbon Treaty is to ensure that the European Parliament has sufficient resources to perform its legislative role. Let us recall that the European Parliament set a limit on its own requirements back in 1988. It defined this limit as amounting to 20% of the overall administrative costs of the institutions. In 2006, in negotiations over the multi-year financial framework for 2007-2013, the European Parliament approved this limit as the maximum of the overall administrative costs of the institutions. Since 2006, the costs of the European Parliament have grown in connection with the Statute for Members, entering into effect, even though on the second page of the very same Statute for Members, funding is set aside in Member State budgets. Today, we also need to cover costs arising from the new role of the European Parliament in connection with the Lisbon Treaty entering into force. It has to be said that the spending limit of 20% did not take into account the Statute for Members or the Lisbon Treaty. In spite of the Statute for Members being in the Lisbon Treaty, we in the Committee on Budgets insisted on the European Parliament budget for 2010 adhering to the 20% limit from the original multi-year financial framework. We have also achieved this.When drafting the 2011 budget, however, we will have to set out the new formula carefully, in order to ensure the sustainability of the budget in the subsequent period. I would like to emphasise that the best way to ensure budget sustainability is to create a budget based on actual needs and not based on inflation indices. Only this approach will ensure that the budget reflects only actual needs, thereby increasing its transparency and efficiency.

One paragraph, however, is a point of principle; it concerns the decision that was made 20 years ago now that Parliament should not take more than 20% of the EU’s administrative budget.This decision will result in us marginally exceeding this limit – but more as a result of technical changes than as a result of a new policy. However, this has given rise to debate concerning the 20% rule. Unless substantial cuts are made, the limit will be exceeded when today’s decision has its full impact in 2011. There is good reason to discuss changing this 20% rule, since Parliament’s role has changed more than that of other institutions, but we should not abandon this principle without due consideration.I am thinking mainly of two aspects. Firstly, we must consider the fact that many Member States are currently under extreme pressure to cut staff and salaries. In such a situation, we cannot continue expanding the EU administration regardless. Secondly, we must bear in mind that we allocate the EU’s administration budget jointly with the other institutions and that in the 1988 decision, we promised that if we were considering abandoning the 20% rule, then this would only take place following dialogue with the Council.

In October last year, we agreed at the conciliation procedure that an administrative audit would be carried out in the European Parliament this year in the INLO Directorate-General and the security service. The aim is to assess whether resources are being used in the best possible way. The audit results should be a point of departure for further progress and greater efficiency. I see further potential savings in the better use of our own resources within the interpreting services or in the area of teleworking. I am expecting up-to-date information from the European Parliament and the other institutions on how they plan to make use of temporarily unexploited resources, not only in the language services but also in rented office space, copying services, etc. I firmly believe that savings in the budget will be achieved through the medium-term strategy in the area of assets and buildings, which will contribute to the sustainability of the EP budget. The European Parliament administration will present the strategy to us in a few days’ time.

327," 23. Amending Budget 1/2010 (Section I, European Parliament) (debate) ","  Alexander Alvaro  (ALDE),  in writing. – (DE) I congratulate Mr Manka on his successful negotiations in view of the very tight framework for the 2010 budget. In addition to thoroughly justifiable and necessary adjustments to the personnel and building policies of the EP, there is the, in my opinion, thorny issue of the planned increase in the secretarial allowance by EUR 1 500. It is unfortunate that, for procedural reasons, it is not possible to vote separately on this, as the increase in the secretarial allowance for MEPs from May 2010 decided on by the Bureau is inappropriate at a time of financial crisis. It is certainly the case that, under the Treaty of Lisbon, which has recently entered into force, Parliament will, overall, need extra capacity for legislative work, but after the introduction of the assistants statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof whatsoever that MEPs actually need more assistants. Furthermore, the ‘purchasing power’ of the additional money is very different in comparison in the individual Member States and this should also be taken into account in a report that is still to be drawn up on the results following the introduction of the new rules for MEPs assistants. In view of the current very limited space and working facilities in Parliament, it is also to be feared that the increase in the secretarial allowance by EUR 1 500 adopted today will already create the conditions for further increases, demands and future working facilities. In light of this, the German Liberal Party (FDP) in the European Parliament will abstain.
