2, 4. Annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2007 (debate),"  Dushana Zdravkova,  rapporteur (BG). − Thank you, Madam President, and thank you for that reminder. During my many years of working as a judge, I have always seen to order in the court. So, Madam President and Mr Diamandouros, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to be the rapporteur for the annual Ombudsman’s report. The Ombudsman is a figure in the European institutional system whose purpose is to defend the rights of European citizens and to counter maladministration. For this reason I would like to congratulate the European Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, for his dedication and his professionalism, because what he does is very important for ordinary people. As Jean Monnet said, we are building Union among people, not cooperation between States.Similarly, I have had the pleasure of working on a report that unites, rather than divides the political groups in the European Parliament. As it is clear that we have been elected to this House by the citizens of Europe to protect their interests, it is with this conviction that we also found compromises to accommodate some of the amendments tabled by the other political groups. These proposals and today’s debate are proof that the European Parliament takes this important mechanism for protecting European citizens very seriously. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Secretariat and all those who contributed to making this report more complete.It is my deep conviction that it is through the institution of the European Ombudsman that citizens will be better able to exercise their rights in cases of maladministration, because even if the rules are good, it is important that they are properly applied to provide maximum protection. I believe that, just as the Commission is called the protector of treaties, the European Ombudsman is the champion of the correct implementation of Community legislation, although it is not alone in this role. The European Parliament, as the only democratically elected institution, is also called upon to uphold citizens’ rights, which makes it all the more important that Parliament and the Ombudsman work hand in hand.The report is also important because analysing the situation as it is in the course of the year will above all help us to learn lessons and take the right decisions for the future. We should not forget that behind every complaint, behind each number in the statistics, is a human being who is expecting the right help and a solution to his or her problem. While I was working on the report, I realised that a key aspect is information. The report shows that many citizens do not yet know how to stand up for the rights given to them by the European Union when faced with maladministration. An example of this is the number of ineligible complaints – 84%. This clearly shows that the Ombudsman and the European institutions must continue in this direction together, and inform European citizens so that they can exercise their rights to the full. That is why the report also proposes  a common website for lodging complaints to all the institutions, something along the lines of the interactive manual designed by the Ombudsman, where citizens who have entered the requisite data are directed to the relevant institution, to which they can then directly lodge their complaint. This will help to reduce the number of inadmissible complaints.Apart from that, I also focussed on what guarantees there are that citizens and those permanently resident in the EU know and make use of their rights, and whether the assistance they are given is easily accessible, fair, impartial and effective. I would like to point out that there is nothing the Ombudsman can do in over 30% of cases. In my view, the Ombudsman should always explain why no action can be taken on a particular complaint, thereby making it more useful to citizens.I would also like to point out that the Ombudsmen at national, regional and local level play a key role, and their activities should be developed.In conclusion, I call upon you to vote for this report, because it supports constructive cooperation between the Ombudsman and the institutions and bodies of the European Union, and confirms the Ombudsman’s role as an external control mechanism and a source of constant improvement for European administration.Thank you.

3, 4. Annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2007 (debate),"  Nikiforos Diamandouros,  Ombudsman. − Madam President, thank you for this opportunity to address Parliament on the annual report of the European Ombudsman for 2007. I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Zdravkova, and the Committee on Petitions for their excellent and constructive report.My report records progress in handling complaints, promoting good administration and providing knowledge about the Ombudsman’s role. The number of admissible complaints increased, in both absolute and relative terms, from 449 (12% of the total) in 2006 to 518 (16% of the total) in 2007. We therefore met both of the objectives which Parliament has consistently emphasised: increasing the number of admissible complaints and reducing the number of inadmissible complaints.The main types of maladministration alleged in admissible complaints were: lack of transparency, including refusal of information; unfairness or abuse of power; unsatisfactory procedures; avoidable delay; discrimination; negligence; legal error; and failure to ensure fulfilment of obligations. Three hundred and forty-eight decisions closing inquiries were made. That represents a 40% increase compared to 2006. In 95 cases, the inquiry revealed no maladministration. Such a finding is not always negative for the complainant, who at least has the benefit of a full explanation from the institution concerned. Even when maladministration is not found, I may identify opportunities to improve the quality of administration provided by institutions. If so, I point them out in a further remark.Many of my inquiries result in a positive sum outcome that satisfies both the complainant and the institution complained against. One hundred and twenty-nine cases were settled by the institution concerned to the satisfaction of the complainant. That is double the number of cases settled in this way in 2006, and reflects a growing willingness on the part of institutions and bodies to regard complaints made to the Ombudsman as an opportunity to recognise and put right mistakes that have occurred.When I find maladministration, I try to achieve a friendly solution. In some cases, this can be achieved by the institution or body concerned by offering compensation to the complainant. Any such offer is made ex gratia, or in other words without admission of legal liability and without creating a legal precedent. When a friendly solution is not possible I close the case with a critical remark. A critical remark is also appropriate if it is no longer possible for the instance of maladministration to be eliminated. It confirms that the complaint is justified and indicates to the institution or body concerned what it is has done wrong. Such a criticism is intended to be constructive, so as to help avoid similar maladministration in the future.It is important for institutions and bodies to follow up critical remarks and to take prompt action to resolve outstanding problems. To better monitor the impact of my criticism, I launched a study of the follow-up to all critical remarks, and to the cases involving a further remark, made in 2006. The results of that study, published on my website and sent to all the bodies concerned, should provide encouragement to the European public service to improve practices and further develop a culture of service to citizens.In cases where it is still possible to eliminate the instance of maladministration, I normally make a draft recommendation to the institution or body. If it fails to respond satisfactorily, I may send a special report to Parliament. I submitted one such report to you criticising the Commission for not dealing with an infringement complaint concerning the European Working Time Directive. I welcome Parliament’s support, as expressed in your resolution of 3 September 2008, based on Mr De Rossa’s report.This year, I have again included star cases in my annual report. These are cases where I consider that institutions or bodies involved responded to my inquiries in an exemplary fashion. Seven such star cases are highlighted. Four of these concerned the Commission, one concerned the Council, one the European Central Bank and one the European Aviation Safety Agency. I have continued to make every effort to ensure that EU institutions and bodies adopt a citizen-centred approach in all their activities, by seeking every opportunity to achieve friendly solutions and by launching more own-initiative inquiries in order to identify problems and encourage best practice.I would now like to mention some other activities undertaken with a view to ensuring the best possible service to citizens. I have continued my efforts to improve the quality of information concerning rights under EU law, provided especially through the European Network of Ombudsmen. That network, which includes the Petitions Committee, cooperates in case handling and in sharing experiences and best practice. One of the purposes of the network is to facilitate the rapid transfer of complaints which are admissible for me to a competent ombudsman or similar body. When possible, I transfer cases directly or give suitable advice to the complainant. During 2007 I was able to help 867 complainants in this manner.A further important initiative which should come to fruition within the next quarter of the year is that my office is developing an interactive guide to help citizens find the most appropriate avenue of redress for their grievances. This guide should enable an even greater proportion of complainants to address directly the body best equipped to deal with the complaint. Complaints which are inadmissible for me will therefore be resolved more promptly and effectively. My institution will then be better able to fulfil its core role – to help citizens who are unhappy with the way they are being treated by EU institutions and bodies.The Ombudsman cannot work alone. Ensuring a top-class administration is a task that must be fulfilled proactively in cooperation with EU institutions and bodies. The increased settlement of cases and friendly solutions is a source of encouragement and serves as an indication of our mutual efforts to contribute to building citizens’ trust, vis-à-vis the Union, at a point in time where that is greatly needed. I am also deeply grateful for Parliament’s support and guidance, both in terms of the budgetary resources you provide my institution with and in terms of the positive relationship I enjoy with the Petitions Committee. With your continued support, I will endeavour to build on the achievements of this past year.Finally, as this is the last occasion during this parliamentary term that I have the honour of presenting my annual report to this House, I would like to put on record my deep appreciation for the close cooperation and good advice that I have received from Parliament and individual Members during the past four and a half years.(Applause) ","Nikiforos Diamandouros,",13,1112,not_available,"['hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv', 'hrv']","['  Nikiforos Diamandouros,  Ombudsman. − Madam President, thank you for this opportunity to address Parliament on the annual report of the European Ombudsman for 2007.

5, 4. Annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2007 (debate),"  Andris Piebalgs,  Member of the Commission. − Madam President, on behalf of the Commission and of my colleague, Vice-President Wallström, let me thank the rapporteur Mrs Zdravkova for her excellent work. We welcome the Committee on Petitions’ report about the Ombudsman’s annual report on his activities in 2007.As you know, this Commission has made a strong commitment to improving its administration, and we are improving. We can see that, both from the Ombudsman’s Annual Report and from the Committee on Petitions report.In 2007 the number of cases in which an institution or a body actually put an end to maladministration practices as a result of a complaint lodged with the Ombudsman doubled. This reflects the willingness of institutions – including, definitely, the Commission – and bodies to regard complaints as an opportunity to correct errors and cooperate with the Ombudsman in the public interest.Also, the number of cases in which no maladministration practice was established increased. The Commission is happy about this, since we are the institution that receives most of these complaints.I also want to underline the fact that the Ombudsman has been proposing an increasing number of friendly solutions in order to settle disputes and that, overall, the Commission has been cooperative and appreciative of this type of proposal, wherever possible. In 2007, only one special report concerning the Commission was submitted to Parliament by the Ombudsman, and the Ombudsman mentioned this.But I would like to remind you that this special report concerns the Working Time Directive, and it was only last month that you had a discussion on that with my colleague Vladimir Špidla.Let me conclude with three specific points which are touched upon in your report as well as the Ombudsman’s Annual Report. First, on infringements. As you are aware, the Commission has reorganised its decision-taking on infringements, with a view to facilitating the progress of cases. This was presented in the 2007 communication ‘A Europe of results – applying Community law’. We are following up cases more actively and organising the work more effectively for citizens. Also, an EU pilot project has been launched. More solutions to problems should be found more quickly.Second, on the call for EU institutions and bodies to adopt a common approach towards a European code of good administrative behaviour. I want to draw your attention to the fact that the Commission has its own code of good administrative behaviour, adopted in 2000. This code still constitutes a modern and very effective instrument. Its implementation is well established. I do not want to prejudge the future, but for the time being we want to keep things that way.Third, regarding the communication policy. The idea of launching an information campaign for European citizens to help them find out more about the duties and competences of the European Ombudsman is definitely welcomed by the Commission.Each institution, including the European Commission, also has its own website, where complaints and petitions may be lodged. The Europa website is common to all EU institutions and has links to all other EU institutions, including the Ombudsman’s website. In this way, citizens are easily and smoothly directed to the bodies able to settle their grievances and complaints. The idea of an interactive manual designed to assist citizens in identifying the most suitable forum for resolving their problems is well worth studying much more closely.Because in all this, we should never lose sight of who comes first and who we do all this for: the European citizens.

8, 4. Annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2007 (debate),"  Marian Harkin,  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a very comprehensive report and also the Ombudsman and his staff on the many positive steps that they took in 2007.What I find most encouraging is that the Ombudsman works at so many different levels: it is not just about processing complaints, which is central to his work, but also about how resolutions or solutions are arrived at. There is an increasing number of friendly solutions, more informal procedures, where relations with the institutions are such that a growing number of cases are solved rapidly.

That paragraph reads: ‘Proposes that the Ombudsman take measures to reduce the number of complaints (a total of 1 021) in relation to which no steps have been taken by him at all’. The oral amendment seeks to change that final phrase – ‘in relation to which no steps have been taken by him at all’ – to the statement ‘in such cases where no action is possible’.From the perspective of the Ombudsman, no action is possible; but from the perspective of the citizen, no action is taken – and those are two very different perspectives.So I have a question: is it made clear to the 1 021 citizens that no action is possible by the Ombudsman, with a clear explanation given with further advice where possible, or is it the case that simply no action is taken? If the former is true and citizens are given reasons, I have no problem and, indeed, I am very pleased. But if the latter is true and no action is taken, then citizens will be frustrated and angry.

9, 4. Annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2007 (debate),"  Margrete Auken,  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – (DA) Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her splendid report. It is a fine piece of work, and we were particularly delighted with the considerable willingness there was to cooperate. I also wish to thank the Ombudsman for his brilliant annual report. The institution of the Ombudsman is, of course, incredibly important for the EU. Its work shows that the EU is closer to Europeans than it is reputed to be, listening as it does to criticism. Happily, it is on the right lines. Far more complaints than last year were resolved to the complainants’ satisfaction through the EU institution itself making proper allowance for them. It shows that the EU system is coming to understand the need to serve people as best as possible. Unfortunately, there are institutions that do not comply with the recommendations. In such circumstances, all that the Ombudsman can do is place the matter before Parliament - an option he can hardly be accused of misusing, since only one case was presented last year to the Committee on Petitions.When a case comes before us in Parliament, we are clearly obliged to say that we are willing, at least in principle, to go to the European Court of Justice if the institution concerned does not comply with the Ombudsman’s decision. In that way, we can give the Ombudsman the necessary clout and authority in the system. On behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I have tabled a couple of amendments, the sole purpose of which is to clarify the concept of maladministration. It should be possible to identify those cases in which the Ombudsman can observe that an institution or other EU body has not complied with the rules and principles applicable to it. However, there is no maladministration in cases in which the Ombudsman merely notes that there is room for improvement in the way in which the institution handles matters. It is that distinction that my amendments are aimed at clarifying.Finally, I have a similar question to that raised by Mrs Harkin, concerning when cases are rejected. We should like to know why they are rejected. The reason should ideally be given in the answers to the complaints, and I want to ask if that is in fact the case, as otherwise matters would be very frustrating, as has already been pointed out.

One is that society within the European Union is following your work, Ombudsman, and thus forming a better idea of which complaints should be addressed to you. You certainly have not changed your policy on what is admissible and what is not. You remain objective, and your work is such that people appreciate it and are coming to understand it better.

I would advise the Commission to be more honest and more modest.It is also a good thing that the number of complaints admitted and the efficacy of the interventions of the European Ombudsman have increased. However, the large majority of complaints still concern matters which do not come directly within his jurisdiction. There is a large proportion of citizens within the European Union who want greater transparency and sound management both from the European institutions and in the application of Community legislation in general and, unfortunately, they do not always find it. That is why the European Parliament has repeatedly called for all the institutions and organisations of the European Union to be given the financial and human resources needed to ensure that citizens receive immediate and in-depth replies to their complaints, questions and referrals.We also need cooperation between the European Ombudsman and the ombudsmen in similar organisations at national, regional and local level in the Member States. We also need to give a broader, more expansive interpretation to the term ‘maladministration’, so that it also includes cases in which the administrative authorities demonstrate sloppiness and negligence or a lack of transparency in the performance of their duties towards the citizens. This will result in more material interventions on the part of the Ombudsman, which is in the citizens' interests. It is also extremely important for the Ombudsman to be able to take up cases relating to all the institutions of the European Union, including those which operate under the third pillar.Finally, I should like to reiterate once again the call to all the institutions and organisations of the European Union to adopt a common approach towards a European code of good administrative behaviour.

12, 4. Annual report on the European Ombudsman's activities in 2007 (debate),"  Nils Lundgren,  on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. – (SV) Madam President, together with Volvo and IKEA, the institution known as the Ombudsman is Sweden’s best-known contribution to the global community. It is a very important institutional innovation for democracy in general and the EU institutions in particular. Why? Well, because an Ombudsman is there to ensure that people can demand their rights in political and bureaucratic structures that are becoming ever more complex and, thus, non-transparent. Nowhere in the democratic world is complexity and non-transparency more dominant than in the byzantine power structure that the EU has established and that it is constantly extending further.It is rare for me to feel any enthusiasm for the reports presented here in the European Parliament. Whenever I do so, the reports concerned are those relating to the internal market or an environmental issue of some kind. Mrs Zdravkova’s report is another exception to my rule, in which we see a picture emerge of the Ombudsman working pretty effectively to fortify individuals against the byzantine hegemony that is unfolding. I am thinking of information provided to the general public via a properly updated website, information sheets, networks of national and regional ombudsmen, conferences and, especially, meetings and other contacts with the system’s eurocrats, designed to make the latter see that they are there for the benefit of Europeans, rather than Europeans being there for the benefit of them.At the same time, it is regrettable that Europe’s powerful elite pursues a European project associated by most people with impenetrable and byzantine bureaucracy. In anticipation of a grassroots reaction against this development, we in the European Parliament should strengthen the institution of the Ombudsman. We should therefore vote in favour of Mrs Zdravkova’s report and, especially, welcome the demand that the Ombudsman have full access to EU documents in the course of his investigations.

The fact that the number of admissible complaints received by the Ombudsman increased in 2007, while the number of inadmissible complaints fell in 2007, compared with 2006, is proof of the fact that European citizens have started to understand the remit of this institution.Furthermore, I in turn welcome the efforts made by Mr Diamandouros to improve the standard of information provided to citizens in connection with their rights under Community law during his time in this position. Mrs Zdravkova also deserves hearty congratulations on having achieved unanimous decisions and cooperation in her first report for our committee. The European Network of Ombudsmen, to which the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament also belongs, has approximately 90 offices in 31 countries.

Announcements by the President,"  President. −    Ladies and gentlemen, Twenty years ago in 1988, the European Parliament instituted the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, which has been awarded every year since then.Over the course of the last twenty years, we have honoured outstanding organisations or figures who have dedicated their lives to defending human rights and fundamental freedoms and who have fought against intolerance, fanaticism and oppression in their own countries and throughout the world. The first person to be awarded the prize was Nelson Mandela, whom I will be meeting next week in Johannesburg as part of an invitation to speak before the Pan-African Parliament.This year the Conference of Presidents has decided to award the Sakharov Prize 2008 to Hu Jia ‘on behalf of the silenced voices of China and Tibet’ as it states in the proposal for a decision from the Committee on Foreign Affairs.(Applause)Hu Jia was born on 25 July 1973 in Beijing and is one of the most passionate defenders of human rights in the People's Republic of China. This dedicated activist is subject to accusations because of his commitment to the environment, his fight against the dangers of HIV and AIDS and his efforts to ensure that human rights are respected.On 27 December 2007, Hu Jia was placed under house arrest on charges of inciting subversion. On 3 April 2008, he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison.In his solitary prison cell, Hu Jia is now fighting his illness. He suffers from cirrhosis of the liver, but as far as we know he is being denied regular medical care.The arbitrary arrest and conviction of Hu Jia has caused outrage throughout the world. By awarding the Sakharov prize to Hu Jia, the European Parliament is demonstrating forcefully and with determination its recognition of the daily fight for freedom carried on by all defenders of human rights in China.(Applause)Ladies and gentlemen, I have another brief statement to make. Tomorrow, on 24 October, we will be celebrating the 63rd anniversary of the United Nations. On this occasion, I would like to highlight the extent, the commitment and the success of the collaboration between the European Union, the European Parliament and the various programmes and institutions of the United Nations.Not long ago a publication entitled ‘Improving Lives’, of which you have all received a copy, presented a summary of the collaboration over the years. In recent weeks, we have seen the start of a difficult period throughout the world, in particular in relation to the financial crisis and its drastic effects on the world economy.In this context in particular, the European Union's fundamental values of multilateral understanding and solidarity are of great importance. This also applies to our commitment to and responsibility for the developing countries. The international conference on development financing which will be held in November will also play a decisive role in this respect. Despite the fact that we are faced with considerable challenges, we must not lose sight of the interests of the developing countries.

39, 6.1. Draft general budget of the European Union - 2009 budget (vote),"  Jutta Haug,  rapporteur. – (DE) Mr President, the explanation process is the same as it is every year. Before the vote I need to inform Parliament about some technical adjustments. I know that this is not very interesting for my fellow Members, but we need to record it in the Minutes.Firstly, as already indicated in the voting list, the vote on amendment 783 to budget line 22 02 04 02 only concerns payment appropriations.Secondly, the explanations concerning the global energy assessment do not belong on budget line 08 03 01, where they have mistakenly been included, but on line 08 05 01. Therefore the vote on amendment 936 to line 08 03 01 must be made without the comments on the global energy assessment. These will be included instead in amendment 938 to line 08 05 01.I know how enthusiastic everyone is about this.Thirdly, the reinstatement of resources in the Preliminary Draft Budget for the decentralised agencies with their titles in lines 1 and 2 also includes, of course, the reinstatement of their establishment plans. This applies to the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency, the European Aviation Safety Agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency, the European Railway Agency, the European Environment Agency, the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, the European Food Safety Authority, the Community Fisheries Control Agency and the Community Plant Variety Office, whose establishment plans are not specifically included in the documents accompanying the amendments.Fourthly, as the result of a comment from the Legal Services an explanation included on several budget lines must be slightly modified. This concerns the sentence which begins ‘The Commission may’ up to ‘and to transfer to the internal auditor of the Commission’ in the following amendments: Amendment 994 to line 19 04 01, amendment 1011 to line 21 02 01, amendment 1015 to line 21 03 01, amendment 1016 to line 21 04 01, amendment 1026 to line 23 02 01 and amendment 785 to line 23 02 02. The correct version of the explanation is detailed in the voting list.Fifthly and finally, the budget line 19 06 06 with the title ‘Consular cooperation’ is not included in the amendments, although it was adopted as part of the amending letter No 1/2009. This new budget line will therefore be included using a token entry (p.m.).If none of my fellow members have any objections to all of this, the sittings service will include it all as we have decided.

65, 10. Explanations of vote,"  Marusya Ivanova Lyubcheva  (PSE) -  (BG) I supported the 2009 budget as well as the proposal to increase it compared to what had been proposed by the Commission. Although it is not enough to meet the huge demands of all Member States, or to fully implement all priority policies, I believe that it lives up to the fundamental principle of the EU, which is solidarity.By directing funds towards the more poorly developed countries and regions, the financial instrument has established itself as an important factor in achieving balanced development. In this regard, the Cohesion Fund plays an important role, as it is aimed at those Member States which need to close the gap between the levels of economic and social development through this fund. It is particularly important for the new Member States, which really do need the financial resources of the Community. I do not believe that these resources should be subject to conditions which are any stricter than the approved rules and procedures of the European Union.They are of great importance in helping Bulgaria catch up in its development and to reach the European Union’s average standard of living.

Although it is not enough to meet the huge demands of all Member States, or to fully implement all priority policies, I believe that it lives up to the fundamental principle of the EU, which is solidarity.', 'By directing funds towards the more poorly developed countries and regions, the financial instrument has established itself as an important factor in achieving balanced development. In this regard, the Cohesion Fund plays an important role, as it is aimed at those Member States which need to close the gap between the levels of economic and social development through this fund. It is particularly important for the new Member States, which really do need the financial resources of the Community. I do not believe that these resources should be subject to conditions which are any stricter than the approved rules and procedures of the European Union.', 'They are of great importance in helping Bulgaria catch up in its development and to reach the European Union’s average standard of living.

In her press statement this week, she cited such countries as China and Vietnam, where she claims that EU funding, channelled through the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), is presently being used for coercive abortions, involuntary sterilisation and infanticide. I spoke to the Director of the UNFPA office in Brussels this morning, who said that the UNFPA, the United Nations population programme, does not support coercion or abortion. It follows the mandate of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development, which clearly states that reproductive health-care programmes should provide the widest range of services without any form of coercion. In addition, the global community has decided that abortion should never have been promoted as a method of family planning. China’s citizens have benefited from the presence of the UNFPA and the initiatives that it has brought to the nation. In the parts of China – and other nations – where the UNFPA works, women are given more options for their reproductive health decisions, and more information about reproductive health care is available to them, as is the freedom of access to it.

For investors, the moves to converge the national standards of accounting to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are a great step forward. It means that companies will be able to publish accounts in one basic form, which should be accepted in the major economies around the world. Canada, China, Japan, the USA – and now, it seems, India as well – are in agreement in the wish to converge their standards towards IFRS.Although I welcome this, as the rapporteur for the transparency directive, I recognise that work to achieve actual convergence still has to be done. This is why I and my fellow rapporteur, Margarita Starkevičiūtė, have approved the amendments to monitor the progress of this convergence process. I trust that the Commission, in their discussions with various national authorities, can keep the momentum moving.

Like many of my fellow Members, I deplore the fact that the Council has further reduced an already meagre budget: the commitment appropriations of the draft budget represent a total amount of EUR 134 billion, that is to say, a shortfall of EUR 469 million with regard to the PDB, even though the payments stand at EUR 115 billion, this being a decrease of EUR 1.8 billion. The payments are thus limited to 0.89% of GNI, that is to say, an unprecedented level that is drastically widening the gap between commitments and payments and this is something that goes against budgetary discipline. With regard to agriculture, I support the creation of three new funds – the fund for restructuring in the dairy sector, Eco-Aid to maintain sheep and goat farming in the EU, and the ad-hoc financial instrument for the adaptation of the fishing fleet to the economic consequences of the rise in fuel prices.

Although none of the budgets covered by this report appear to present any major problems, I remain convinced that the European Parliament is not equipped with the resources to match the political responsibilities it has acquired by virtue of the development of the Treaties and the work of its Members, and, moreover, by virtue of its role in reducing the gap that has set in between European integration and the people, a gap that has been confirmed again and again by the various recent referendums. Like the great majority of my fellow Members, I support the proposal to strengthen the European Court of Auditors’ audit capacity with the creation of 20 posts. The costs associated with funding the extension of the Court building must be kept as low as possible for taxpayers, and it is a good idea to fund this expenditure directly from the budget over four years, rather than to conceal the significantly higher costs that would result from a 25-year rental-purchase option.

100, 10. Explanations of vote,"  Hélène Goudin and Nils Lundgren  (IND/DEM),  in writing. − (SV) The report’s starting point is increased interinstitutional cooperation by means of a general increase in services within the EU's institutions. The rapporteur believes that efficiency will be increased in this way. For example, it is proposed that personnel resources for the political groups should increase by 53 services. Moreover, a further two higher services are to be set up, in addition to the new services included in the draft budget.The June List is very well disposed towards making the EU system more efficient, but does not believe that this is automatically achieved by means of more services. In principle, we are opposed to an increase, both in the EU budget and in the number of services, because we believe that this would involve increased bureaucracy and less national self-determination. When it comes to more services in the political groups, we maintain that this would be of most benefit to the large groups – a development that would make it harder work for other groups to conduct their own policies.Moreover, the European Parliament has already in the past taken steps to introduce EU contributions to special ‘EU parties’ and party-political foundations linked to these.

It exploits the cases of piracy in an area in which the imperialist aspirations of the ΕU, the USA, Russia and other forces clash to impose and safeguard the presence of EU military forces which, with a fistful of weapons, will promote its imperialist plans to gain geostrategic control.The European Parliament welcomes the decision by the EU Council to set up and send a euro-unifying naval force, which is basically a strike force for the European monopoly business groups seeking greater penetration and redistribution of the markets for their own benefit. This new imperialist operation will mean even greater plundering of the wealth-producing resources in the area, more exploitation of the people in order to safeguard monopoly profits and new dangers of opportunist wars on the battleground of the competing imperialists.The people can repel these new imperialist plans and impose their inalienable right to determine their own future and fate on the basis of their own interests against these imperialist plans and ambitions.

This need to harmonise interests traditionally arises in the area of freedom and privacy in particular. These concerns have arisen once again in this case and demand an appropriate response which we believe can be given. If we take into account, on the one hand, the level of invasion of current methods and, on the other hand, the answers provided by solutions which involve the recording of images and ensure a physical distance between the security person and the passenger being checked, it seems that some of these questions have been overcome or at least could be overcome.There is, however, another question which I believe has not been sufficiently covered and which raises major concerns. The health implications of this technology have not yet been adequately studied. The value put at risk in this case, namely the health of citizens, demands that care be taken.

The increase in the number of complaints lodged confirms the importance of this information.It should be remembered that the Ombudsman now has more powers, following changes adopted by the European Parliament at his request.

Of these, 64% concerned the European Commission, 14% EPSO (European Personnel Selection Office), 9% the European Parliament and 1% the Council of the European Union. The main types of alleged maladministration were lack of transparency, including refusal of information, unfairness and abuse of powers, unsatisfactory procedures, avoidable delay, discrimination, negligence, legal errors and failure to ensure fulfilment of obligations.

141, 13.1. Venezuela,"  Renate Weber,  author. − Mr President, for several years the situation of the Opposition in Venezuela has been very difficult, and questioning Venezuelan democracy has been legitimate.But what is happening at the moment is proof that Venezuela’s democracy and the rule of law are a mockery. To use an administrative measure in order to ban people for 15 years from holding or running for official positions is unacceptable. Only the courts should be allowed to take such decisions, and only after convicting perpetrators of serious crimes.The perversity of this measure can be easily noticed when it is realised that the vast majority of those banned are from the political Opposition, a practice that most likely will not be used only for the elections this November but may continue for the elections which will follow.It is not surprising that this political disqualification is happening at a time when human rights advocates who criticise the current government are being expelled from Venezuela and when very suspicious accidents, resulting in the deaths of people who expressed criticisms, are not properly investigated.The European Parliament must send a firm message to public opinion in Venezuela that political disqualification is an undemocratic practice and is contrary to the very foundation of the rule of law.

At heart, the inclusion of this debate on the agenda and the motion for a resolution are simply intended to respond to those who support and encourage an already long-standing and worrying attempt to interfere with and destabilise a democratic and sovereign state.The aim is to blatantly promote interference in Venezuela’s internal affairs, by trying to meddle and exert pressure from outside in order to impose decisions that only the Venezuelan people have the sovereign right to take. Instead of distorting the facts and trying to give Venezuela lessons on democracy, the European Parliament should have included on the agenda a debate about the EU’s attempt to impose a proposed European Treaty, which has already been rejected, in total disregard for the democratic decisions sovereignly taken by the French, Dutch and Irish people, and also bearing in mind the refusal to allow other people to give their opinion through referendums. Instead of meddling in something which only the Venezuelan people can decide, the European Parliament should have rejected the inhumane return directive which disregards and violates the human rights of immigrants, many of whom are from Latin America.What really bothers the sponsors of this initiative is the fact that the Venezuelan people have set an example which is causing problems for the major financial and economic interests that control the European Union.

150, 13.1. Venezuela,"  Kathy Sinnott  (IND/DEM). -   Mr President, when one thinks of democracy, one thinks of human rights. The importance of a voice and a vote at all levels of government is very understandable. For years this has not been the case in Venezuela, a country rife with corruption and currently led by Mr Chávez. Under his government, there is a history of intimidation of Opposition members, cases of Opposition party members being brutally murdered, and defenders of human rights and members of NGOs having been forcibly removed.

Under his government, there is a history of intimidation of Opposition members, cases of Opposition party members being brutally murdered, and defenders of human rights and members of NGOs having been forcibly removed.

Some of them have been monitored by European Observation Missions which concluded that, in general, they complied with international standards and national legislation. Others have not, as was the case with the last referendum, since we were not invited.The Commission is aware of the concerns expressed by some of you and also many sectors of Venezuelan society about the constitutionality of the ‘disqualifications’. These are believed by some to be intended to obstruct the full participation of the opposition in the November elections.The Commission has taken note of the explanation provided on several occasions by the Venezuelan authorities, in relation to the constitutionality of these ‘administrative sanctions’ imposed by the State Controller on a number of civil servants.We stress the importance of guaranteeing the rights of all citizens who want to participate in the elections, in accordance with the Constitution and the rule of law. We hope that the upcoming elections will strengthen democracy in Venezuela and that the results will reflect the views of the whole of Venezuelan society.We encourage all actors to engage in the electoral process in a spirit of tolerance, civic-mindedness and respect for pluralism of opinions.The Commission is also aware of the expulsion of the representatives of Human Rights Watch from Venezuela. We have heard the voices which have condemned this decision as a measure which adversely affects the right to freedom of expression and an act demonstrating an intolerant attitude towards criticism. In this context, we stress the importance that the EU attaches to freedom of expression and opinion.

The conflict that we are talking about has many causes. We are talking about a problem that concerns access to resources. We are also talking about the impunity with which these resources are exploited, the impunity with which certain people ‘wander’ around the region committing atrocities without being prosecuted either by local authorities or by international forces and, thirdly, the impunity resulting in the constant presence of international arms which keep arriving in the region.I feel that these three elements, and the link between them, are fundamental because they firstly highlight the need for an in-depth review of the United Nations’ presence in the region.Secondly, we must very closely study the issue of violence perpetrated against women, particularly sexual violence. This is an issue that we have discussed before in this House. We should take this opportunity to again insist that both the United Nations and the European Union demand that rape and in particular recourse to the torture and abuse of women as a sexual weapon are regarded as war crimes.

The consistent and precise application of monitoring mechanisms such as the Kimberley process is absolutely fundamental to this basic issue.Please allow me to remind you that, next week in the United Nations, a debate will begin on the adoption of an international treaty on arms exports.

Worrying information has recently emerged from North Kivu, concerning hundreds of dead bodies dumped in rivers and around one hundred thousand displaced people.Not only is the war causing fatalities, but it is also resulting in devastation, more acute hunger and widespread demoralisation. The Congolese authorities and army will not be able to resolve the region’s problems on their own. International assistance is required, including assistance from the European Union.

Worrying information has recently emerged from North Kivu, concerning hundreds of dead bodies dumped in rivers and around one hundred thousand displaced people.', 'Not only is the war causing fatalities, but it is also resulting in devastation, more acute hunger and widespread demoralisation. The Congolese authorities and army will not be able to resolve the region’s problems on their own. International assistance is required, including assistance from the European Union. Material aid in the form of food and medical aid is also urgently needed. The Union for Europe of the Nations Group fully supports this resolution before the House.

Democratic Republic of Congo: clashes in the eastern border areas,"  Gerard Batten  (IND/DEM). -   Mr President, the atrocities endured in the Congo are unimaginable to those of us who live in peaceful civilised societies. How can we offer practical help to people such as the Congolese? Direct military intervention and humanitarian aid must only come from international effort under the auspices of the United Nations, but time and time again we see the leaders of these types of failed states being allowed to plunder their countries and enjoy their wealth in the Western world. The stable and peaceful countries of the world should unite to ensure that vast amounts of wealth cannot be stolen and then deposited in western banks with impunity.International agreements should be reached to ensure that leaders of such states cannot live off their ill-gotten gains.

167, 13.2. Democratic Republic of Congo: clashes in the eastern border areas,"  Andris Piebalgs,  Member of the Commission. − Mr President, the Commission shares the concerns about the degraded situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which is causing further stress to an already seriously affected population. It is also particularly worried about the widespread human rights violations in the region, including violence against women and the continuous mobilisation of child soldiers in the conflict.The Commission restates its conviction that the current crisis involving Kinshasa and the Congolese rebel groups has no military solution. Hence, we encourage all parties to this conflict to rapidly resume dialogue and promote courageous political compromises, taking into consideration the commitments agreed upon in January 2008, the so-called Actes d’engagement de Goma.In this context, it is extremely important to restore acceptable confidence levels amongst all Congolese stakeholders directly involved. As a preliminary step, all parties without exception should abide without delay by an effective ceasefire with a view to implementing the military disengagement plan provided by the United Nations.In addition, it must be borne in mind that the underlying root causes of the conflict also include the dramatic problems posed by foreign armed groups in Democratic Republic of Congo territory, in particular the Rwandan FDLR, an issue where most of the DRC commitments taken in the Nairobi communiqué have still to be put into action.Given the multiple challenges which still lie ahead in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Commission strongly advocates that the UN’s peacekeeping mission mandate should be renewed and, where possible, strengthened in order to ensure effective protection for the population and support to the Congolese army in tackling the foreign armed groups.In addition to the relentless efforts of the EU facilitation team, it is important to ensure the broader participation of African diplomacy (including the African Union) in the resolution of the eastern DRC conflicts, especially in areas where a sustainable solution would be greatly facilitated by close cooperation between neighbouring countries, in particular the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda.As regards our support to the population in conflict-affected areas, the Commission will continue to provide support via both our humanitarian and development cooperation.More specifically, regarding health services (an issue raised by all the resolutions), it is important to stress that the Commission has been active since 1994 in the health sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is today one of the focal sectors of our cooperation.In addition to humanitarian aid, we are currently providing strategic and financial support to the Congolese authorities to improve the quality of medical services and the qualifications of medical staff.

173, 13.3. Burma,"  Raül Romeva i Rueda,  author. – (ES) Mr President, tomorrow’s Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Beijing affords an excellent opportunity for the attending Heads of State or Government of the European Union to once again raise the worrying situation of human rights in Burma.As already requested in a letter from Amnesty International, it would be absolutely appropriate for the President-in-Office of the Council, Nicolas Sarkozy, as joint chair of the ASEM, to express Europe’s very great concern about the more than 2 100 political prisoners and also to demand their immediate release.Another source of concern is the current military offensive against the Karen populations in the east of the country, where the biggest military operation in a decade has taken place. The operation’s direct target is the civilian population and has led to the internal displacement of 150 000 people. In June 2006, Amnesty International proved that this type of practice did in fact constitute a crime against humanity.Furthermore, as requested by Burma Campaign Spain and Burma Campaign International among others, the fundamental political problems will be discussed for the first time during the planned visit in December of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The Secretary-General has already recently visited the country on two occasions, following cyclone ‘Nargis’ earlier this year.We have certainly never before had such a seemingly broad consensus among Europeans and Asians on combining forces and putting pressure on the regime to release all political prisoners. That is why the meeting which will begin tomorrow is so vitally important.It is regrettable that the United Nations has for so long ignored, and sometimes even believed, the lies of the regime, as proven by the fact that, following 37 visits made by the UN Envoy, no significant progress has been observed.That is why I must add my voice to those calling on both the European Heads of State or Government – obviously including the Spanish Prime Minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero – and the United Nations to show that they truly support a change in Burma. It is therefore vital that they call for the immediate release of those detained.The opportunity available as from tomorrow must not therefore be lost and the Heads of State or Government must respond in line with expectations.I trust that these Heads of State or Government, in particular President Sarkozy, will be able to rise to the occasion, that they will be particularly aware of the gravity of the situation and that they will act accordingly. If the European Union truly wants to be a credible political player, with a foreign policy based on the defence and promotion of human rights, and if it does not want to appear, as so often happens, to simply be serving the economic interests of major companies such as Total and Chevron, then this is the moment to prove it.

The international community should impose economic sanctions, and also freeze the assets of government members and persons connected with them. ']"
178, 13.3. Burma,"  Kathy Sinnott,  on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. – Mr President, Burma is a country which is steeped in corruption. With 2 000 political prisoners under arrest, access to free media impeded by the authorities and widespread slavery in industry, the people of this country need serious help.However, in spite of more than 37 visits by UN envoys in the past 20 years and six resolutions in this House, there has been not a single reform made by the military junta. I would agree with Mr Matsakis that it is not good enough to point to Burma: we must point to Burma’s supporters and main supporter, especially China, its most powerful economic and military ally. Yet a smiling Mr Sarkozy represented the European Council at this summer’s Olympic Games. Did he press China’s top officials, who stood with him, about the Burmese, about the Sudanese, about the people of Tibet and about China’s own persecuted people?I particularly also want to mention the misuse of aid funds that go into Burma, because we still try to reach the ordinary people of Burma and, yet, these goods are often given to favourites of the Burmese Government to resell at high value.

This is therefore a good time for the European Union and the President-in-Office of the Council, who are in Beijing at the Asia-Europe Meeting, to very formally declare that the situation in Burma is unacceptable, to exert the necessary pressure, particularly on China, as has already been suggested by several Members, to follow the example set in particular by the US in 2003, and to refuse to keep importing clothing made under conditions of abject slavery. In addition, sanctions which are absolutely clear and consistent must be imposed. If this could be done, I believe we would finally start to see changes in the Burmese situation.

If all the Members of this House raise their voices, however, and are joined by those in other countries, then the citizens of countries enduring repression will realise it is worth telling the truth and standing up to such regimes. They will realise that their efforts will eventually bear fruit and their morale will be strengthened. Nonetheless, it is also the case that specific measures are needed in addition to mere words, in order to demonstrate to the junta that it is not worth persevering with oppression to the bitter end, because of its impact on the nation and on the authorities themselves.

182, 13.3. Burma,"  Gerard Batten  (IND/DEM). -   Mr President, earlier this year we saw the failure of the Burmese Government to deal with the consequences of a natural disaster in that country. Considering the amount of money spent by the military on its own upkeep and the tight hold it has on national life, one might at least have expected it to be able to respond to the needs of its own people in a humanitarian crisis. It did not, because it has no real function, except to perpetuate its own existence and stranglehold on power.Referring back to what I said in my previous remarks on the Congo, I wonder how many of the military junta have bank accounts in Western banks and enjoy shopping trips to London, Paris and Rome. A direct way of showing support for the Burmese people would be for democratic countries to stop them coming until human rights and democracy are practised in Burma.

I think that Mr Matsakis quite rightly stressed that the key to the situation in Burma lies both in Moscow and especially in Beijing and Dehli. Pressure must be increased not only on Burma, but on those other countries as well. Secondly, the observation made by Mr Pinior is very important and I agree with him wholeheartedly –that we must watch how much that pressure on Burma and those sanctions against Burma affect the junta and how much they affect ordinary people. I would like to invite the European Commission to analyse how adversely all these steps will affect the actions of the junta and how much they will affect the people. It seems to me that Burma must be encouraged to open up to the rest of the world in every way possible. Only then will that country be able to take the road to democracy.

185, 13.3. Burma,"  Andris Piebalgs,  Member of the Commission. − Mr President, I would like to start by reminding you that the Commission’s response to the cyclone last May was quick and substantial. We provided humanitarian and food aid and worked through the civil protection mechanism in cooperation with the EU Member States.We are pleased with ASEAN’s active role in coordinating international efforts. The Commission funded the largest part of the needs assessment undertaken jointly by ASEAN, the United Nations and the Government. The humanitarian emergency is not over, but we will now also look at rehabilitation issues. Most remarkable during this period has been the outpouring of solidarity among citizens, local NGOs and the Myanmar Red Cross. This is a clear signal that giving up on civil society is not an option.The problems that need to be addressed are the following:Firstly, we must reduce the isolation of the Burmese people. Civil society needs strengthening. The Commission is co-hosting a conference on the role of civil society in Myanmar in Brussels, which will take place on 29 October.Secondly, we must keep open all possible channels of communication with the Government. At the ASEM Summit, which will take place in Beijing on 26 October, President Barroso is expected to take the floor. In addition, the Commission has established working relations with line ministries in matters of health, education and livelihoods.Thirdly, we must keep and strengthen the United Nations as a driving force. There is no alternative to the good offices of the UN Secretary-General and the UN Special Adviser, Ibrahim Gambari. The Commission strongly backs the efforts of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Myanmar, Mr Tomás Ojea Quintana.National reconciliation also requires an inclusive dialogue. It cannot take place with political stakeholders in jail or under house arrest. We continue to request the release of all those being detained on political grounds. The Commission also backs the ILO efforts to end forced-labour practices used for military and infrastructural programmes.The Commission is using all its channels to express concerns regarding forced labour and non-respect for fundamental freedoms.
